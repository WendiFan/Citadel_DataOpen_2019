(2) Chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to an individual that are (a) residential property gains (see Schedule 1B); or (b) carried interest gains (see subsections (9) to (11) );are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 18% or 28%. (3) Other chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to an individual are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 10% or 20%. (4) The question as to which of the rates applies to the gains concerned is determined by section 1I (income taxed at higher rates or gains exceeding unused basic rate band). (5) Chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to the personal representatives of a deceased individual that are (a) residential property gains; or (b) carried interest gains;are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 28%. (6) Other chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to the personal representatives of a deceased individual are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 20%. (7) Residential property gains accruing in a tax year to the trustees of a settlement are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 28%. (8) Other chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to the trustees of a settlement are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 20%. (9) For the purposes of this section chargeable gains are carried interest gains if they accrue to an individual (X) (a) under section 103KA (2) or (3) (investment management services); or (b) as a result of carried interest arising to X under arrangements not involving a partnership under which X performs investment management services directly or indirectly in respect of an investment scheme. (10) A gain is not a carried interest gain under subsection (9) (b) if the carried interest constitutes a co-investment repayment or return. (11) Expressions used in subsection (9) or (10) have the same meaning as they have in Chapter 5 of Part 3. 1IIncome taxed at higher rates or gains exceeding unused basic rate band (1) If any of an individuals income for a tax year is chargeable to income tax at a higher income tax rate; gains accruing to the individual in the tax year are charged (a) at the rate of 28% (if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains); or (b) at the rate of 20% (if they are other kinds of gains). (2) If (a) none of an individuals income for a tax year is chargeable to income tax at a higher income tax rate; but (b) the individual is chargeable to capital gains tax for the tax year on an amount that exceeds the unused part of the individuals basic rate band;the excess (the higher rate excess) is charged at the rate of 28% (so far as comprising residential property gains or carried interest gains) or at the rate of 20% (so far as comprising other kinds of gains). (3) The remainder of this section sets out special rules which apply depending on the nature of the gains within subsection (2) (b). (4) If (a) the gains consist of or include gains (entrepreneur or investor gains) chargeable at the rate of 10% under section 169N (3) or 169VC (2); and (b) the total amount of the entrepreneur or investor gains exceeds the unused part of the individuals basic rate band;that unused part is used fully against those gains. (5) The effect of so doing is that other gains comprised in the higher rate excess are then charged (a) at the rate of 28% (if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains); or (b) at the rate of 20% (if they are other kinds of gains). (6) If the total amount of the entrepreneur or investor gains does not exceed the unused part of the individuals basic rate band (a) so much of that unused part as is equal to that total amount is used against those gains; and (b) accordingly; the higher rate excess consists only of gains other than entrepreneur or investor gains. (7) The individual may allocate so much of the unused part of the individuals basic rate band as then remains to (a) any residential property gains or carried interest gains; or (b) any other gains. (8) The effect of the allocation is that the gains to which the allocation is made are charged (a) at the rate of 18% (if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains); or (b) at the rate of 10% (if they are other kinds of gains). (9) Any gains to which no allocation is made are charged (a) at the rate of 28% (if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains); or (b) at the rate of 20% (if they are other kinds of gains). 1JSection 1I: definitions and other supplementary provision (1) For the purposes of section 1Ia higher income tax rate means (a) the higher rate or the default higher rate; (b) the savings higher rate; or (c) the dividend upper rate; andthe unused part of the individuals basic rate band means the amount by which the basic rate limit exceeds the individuals Step 3 income. (2) If an individual is entitled to relief for a tax year under section 539 of ITTOIA 2005 (contracts for life insurance) by reference to the amount of a deficiency; the individuals Step 3 income for the tax year is treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by the amount of the deficiency. (3) If; as a result of section 669 (1) and (2) of ITTOIA 2005 (inheritance tax on accrued income); there is a reduction in the residuary income of an estate for a tax year that reduces an individuals income by any amount; the individuals Step 3 income for the tax year is treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by the amount of that reduction in the individuals income. (4) If an individual has life insurance gains for a tax year; the individuals Step 3 income for the tax year is treated for the purposes of this section as if the amount of those gains were limited to (a) the annual equivalent within the meaning of section 536 (1) of ITTOIA 2005; or (b) the total annual equivalent within the meaning of section 537 of that Act;as the case may be. (5) If (a) an individual has life insurance gains for a tax year; (b) relief is given under section 535 of ITTOIA 2005 for the tax year; and (c) the calculation under section 536 (1) or 537 of that Act for the tax year does not involve the higher rate;the individual is treated for the purposes of section 1I as if none of the individuals income were chargeable to income tax at the higher rate; the default higher rate or the dividend upper rate. (6) In the application of section 1I in the case of any individual it is to be assumed that the individual is not a Scottish or Welsh taxpayer. (7) In this sectionthe individuals Step 3 income means so much of the individuals total income for the tax year as is left after taking Step 3 under section 23 of ITA 2007 (income tax liability calculation); andlife insurance gains; in relation to an individual; means the amount or amounts treated as the individuals income as a result of section 465 of ITTOIA 2005 (gains from contracts for life insurance). (8) Expressions used in this section which have a meaning when used in the Income Tax Acts have the same meaning in this section. Annual exempt amount 1KAnnual exempt amount (1) If an individual is (or; apart from this section; would be) chargeable to capital gains tax for a tax year on chargeable gains; the annual exempt amount for the year is to be deducted from those gains (but no further than necessary to eliminate them). (2) The annual exempt amount for a tax year is 12;000. (3) The annual exempt amount may not be deducted from chargeable gains to which paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 applies (foreign gains of non-UK domiciled individuals accruing in one year and remitted in later year). (4) The deduction of the annual exempt amount (a) is made after the deduction of allowable losses accruing in the tax year; but (b) is made before the deduction of allowable losses accruing in a previous tax year or; if section 62 applies; in a subsequent tax year. (5) The annual exempt amount may be deducted from gains in whatever way is most beneficial to a person chargeable to capital gains tax (irrespective of the rate of tax at which the gains would otherwise have been charged). (6) An individual is not entitled to an annual exempt amount for a tax year if section 809B of ITA 2007 (claim for remittance basis) applies to the individual for the year. (7) For the tax year in which an individual dies and for the next two tax years; this section applies to the individuals personal representatives as if references to the individual were to those personal representatives. (8) This section applies in relation to trustees in accordance with the provision made by Schedule 1C. 1LIncreasing annual exempt amount to reflect increases in CPI (1) If the consumer prices index for the September before the start of a tax year is higher than it was for the previous September (a) the annual exempt amount is increased by the same percentage as the rise in that index (rounded up to the nearest 100); and (b) section 1K (2) has effect for the tax year (and subsequent tax years) as if it referred to the increased amount. (2) If; as a result of this section; the annual exempt amount for a tax year increases; the Treasury must before the start of the tax year make an order showing the increased amount. Temporary periods of non-residence 1MTemporary non-residents (1) If; in the case of the disposal of an asset by an individual who is temporarily non-resident (a) a gain or loss accrues to the individual in the temporary period of non-residence; and (b) the asset is not excluded from this subsection by section 1N (certain assets acquired in that period);the gain or loss is treated instead as accruing to the individual in the period of return. (2) If (a) a gain is; as a result of subsection (1); treated as accruing to an individual in a tax year for which the remittance basis applies to the individual; (b) the tax year consists of or includes the period of return; and (c) the gain was remitted to the United Kingdom in the temporary period of non-residence;the gain is treated instead as remitted to the United Kingdom in the period of return. (3) If (a) an individual is temporarily non-resident; and (b) a gain would; as a result of section 86; have accrued to the individual in a tax year falling wholly or partly in the temporary period of non-residence if the individual had been resident in the United Kingdom for that year;the gain is treated instead as accruing to the individual in the period of return (but see also section 86A). (4) Nothing in any double taxation arrangements prevents a charge to capital gains tax arising as a result of this section. (5) Nothing in this section is to affect a gain or loss which; apart from this section; would be chargeable to capital gains tax or would be an allowable loss. (6) For the purposes of this section each of the following expressions has the meaning given by Part 4 of Schedule 45 to the Finance Act 2013 (statutory residence test: anti-avoidance) the period of returntemporarily non-residentthe temporary period of non-residence. (7) In this section the reference to the remittance basis applying to an individual for a tax year is to section 809B; 809D or 809E of ITA 2007 applying to the individual for the year. 1NSection 1M (1) : assets acquired in temporary period of non-residence (1) An asset is excluded from section 1M (1) if (a) it was acquired by the individual in the temporary period of non-residence; (b) the acquisition was otherwise than by means of a disqualifying no gain/no loss disposal; (c) there is no reduction in the consideration for the acquisition under section 23 (4) (b) or (5) (b); 152 (1) (b); 153 (1) (b); 162 (3) (b) or 247 (2) (b) or (3) (b) by reference to a UK resident disposal; and (d) the asset is not an interest created by or arising under a settlement. (2) This exclusion does not apply in the case of an asset (the new asset) if (a) on a disposal of the new asset a gain or loss is treated as a result of 116 (10) or (11); 134 or 154 (2) or (4) as accruing (ignoring section 1M); (b) the gain or loss is calculated by reference to another asset (the old asset); and (c) the new asset is one that meets the conditions for exclusion but the old asset does not. (3) For the purposes of this section a UK resident disposal means a disposal by a person (P) of an asset which was acquired by P at a time when (a) P was resident in the United Kingdom; and (b) P was not Treaty non-resident. (4) For the purposes of this section a disqualifying no gain/no loss disposal means a UK resident disposal to which section 58; 73 or 258 (4) applies. Interpretation 1ODefinitions used in ChapterIn this Chapter any reference to a person who is; or is not; UK resident is to be read in accordance with section 1A (4). CHAPTER 2Corporation tax on chargeable gains Corporation tax on chargeable gains: the general scheme 2Corporation tax on chargeable gains (1) As a result of section 2 (1) and (2) of CTA 2009; corporation tax is charged on chargeable gains accruing to a company on the disposal of assets. (2) The charge to corporation tax on chargeable gains has effect in accordance with this Act and all other relevant provisions of the Corporation Tax Acts. 2ACompanys total profits to include chargeable gains (1) The amount of chargeable gains to be included in a companys total profits for an accounting period is the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the company in the period after deducting (a) any allowable losses accruing to the company in the period; and (b) so far as not previously deducted under this subsection; any allowable losses previously accruing to the company while it was within the charge to corporation tax. (2) For the purposes of corporation tax on gains allowable loss does not include a loss accruing to a company if; had a gain accrued; the company would not have been chargeable to corporation tax on the gain. Territorial scope 2BTerritorial scope of charge to corporation tax on chargeable gains (1) A company which is resident in the United Kingdom in an accounting period is chargeable to corporation tax on chargeable gains accruing to the company in the period on the disposal of assets wherever situated. (2) This is subject to Chapter 3A of Part 2 of CTA 2009 (exemption from charge in respect of profits of foreign permanent establishments). (3) A company which is not resident in the United Kingdom is chargeable to corporation tax on chargeable gains that (a) accrue to the company on the disposal of assets situated in the United Kingdom that have a relevant connection to the companys UK permanent establishment (see section 2C); (b) accrue at a time when it has that permanent establishment; and (c) are; in accordance with sections 20 to 32 of CTA 2009; attributable to that permanent establishment. (4) In addition; a company which is not resident in the United Kingdom is chargeable to corporation tax on chargeable gains accruing to the company on the disposal of assets not within subsection (3) that are (a) interests in UK land; or (b) assets (wherever situated) not within paragraph (a) that derive at least 75% of their value from UK land where the company has a substantial indirect interest in that land. (5) Section 1C applies for the purposes of subsection (4) (a) as it applies for the purposes of section 1A (3) (b) (disposing of interests in UK land). (6) The reference in subsection (4) (b) to assets deriving at least 75% of their value from UK land where the company has a substantial indirect interest in that land is to be read in accordance with Schedule 1A. 2CNon-UK resident company with UK permanent establishment (1) For the purposes of section 2B (3) a company has a UK permanent establishment at any time if; at that time; the company carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment there. (2) For the purposes of section 2B (3) an asset has a relevant connection to a companys UK permanent establishment if (a) it is; or was; used in or for the purposes of the trade at or before the time of the disposal; (b) it is; or was; used or held for the purposes of the permanent establishment at or before that time; or (c) it is acquired for use by or for the purposes of the permanent establishment. (3) Section 2B (3) does not apply to a company which; as a result of Part 2 of TIOPA 2010 (double taxation arrangements); is exempt from corporation tax for the accounting period in respect of the profits of the permanent establishment. (4) In the case of the long-term business of an overseas life insurance company; subsection (2) has effect as if for paragraph (b) there were substituted (b) it is; or was; used or held for the purposes of the permanent establishment at or before that time (irrespective of where it is situated at that time);. (5) In this section references to a trade include an office and references to carrying on a trade include holding an office. Application of CGT principles etc 2DApplication of CGT principles in calculating gains and losses (1) The total amount of chargeable gains to be included in a companys total profits for an accounting period is calculated for corporation tax purposes in accordance with capital gains tax principles. (2) All of the following questions are determined in accordance with the enactments relating to capital gains tax as if accounting periods were tax years (a) any question as to the amounts to be; or not to be; taken into account as chargeable gains or allowable losses; (b) any question as to the amounts to be; or not to be; taken into account in calculating gains or losses; (c) any question as to the amounts charged to tax as a companys gains; and (d) any question as to the time when any amount is treated as accruing. (3) This section is subject to any provision made elsewhere by the Corporation Tax Acts. 2EReferences to income tax or Income Tax Acts in case of companies (1) If the CGT enactments contain any reference to (a) income tax; or (b) the Income Tax Acts;the reference is; in relation to a company; to be read as a reference to corporation tax or the Corporation Tax Acts. (2) But (a) this does not affect references to income tax in section 39 (2); and (b) so far as the CGT enactments operate by reference to matters of any specified description; account is to be taken for corporation tax purposes of matters of that description confined to companies but not of any confined to individuals. (3) In this section the CGT enactments means the enactments relating to capital gains tax. 2FInteraction of capital gains tax and corporation tax (1) This Act as it has effect in accordance with this Chapter is not to be affected in its operation by the fact that capital gains tax and corporation tax are distinct taxes. (2) But this Act is; so far as it is consistent with the Corporation Tax Acts; to apply in relation to capital gains tax and corporation tax on gains as if they were one tax. (3) Accordingly; a matter which in a case involving two individuals is relevant to both of them in relation to capital gains tax is in a similar case involving an individual and a company (a) relevant to the individual in relation to capital gains tax; and (b) relevant to the company in relation to corporation tax. Supplementary 2GAssets of a company vested in a liquidator (1) If assets of a company are vested in a liquidator (a) this Chapter; and (b) the enactments applied by this Chapter;apply as if the assets were vested in the company and as if the acts of the liquidator in relation to the assets were the companys acts. (2) Accordingly; acquisitions from or disposals to the liquidator by the company are ignored. (3) The assets may be vested in the liquidator under section 145 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or Article 123 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 or otherwise. CHAPTER 3Attribution of gains of non-UK resident close companies Gains of non-UK resident companies not otherwise chargeable 3Gains attributed to UK resident individuals etc (1) This section applies if (a) a chargeable gain accrues at any time to a non-UK resident close company; (b) the gain is connected to avoidance (see section 3A); (c) the gain is not connected to a foreign trade or other economically significant foreign activities (see section 3A); and (d) apart from this section; some or all of the gain would not be chargeable to corporation tax on the company. (2) So much of the gain as would not otherwise be so chargeable is apportioned among participators; or indirect participators; in the company (a) who are resident in the United Kingdom at that time; or (b) who are trustees of a settlement and are not resident in the United Kingdom at that time. (3) The proportion of the amount of the gain to be apportioned to each person corresponds to the extent of the persons interest in the company as a participator or indirect participator. (4) The amount apportioned to each person is treated as a chargeable gain accruing to the person. (5) No apportionment of any part of a gain is made to an individual if (a) the gain accrues in a tax year which; as respects the individual; is a split year; and (b) the gain accrues in the overseas part of the year. (6) No apportionment of any part of a gain is made to a person if the total amount that would; apart from this subsection; be apportioned to (a) the person; and (b) persons connected to the person;is 25% or less of the amount of the gain falling to be apportioned. (7) A person (P) is an indirect participator in a company (A) if (a) another company (B) which is a non-UK resident close company is a participator in A; and (b) P is a participator in B or P is a participator in a third non-UK resident close company which is participator in B;and so on through any number of non-UK resident close companies that are participators in other non-UK resident close companies. (8) Ps interest as an indirect participator in A in the case of any gain is determined by (a) apportioning the gain among the participators in A according to the extent of their respective interests as participators; and (b) then further apportioning the gain apportioned to B among the participators in B according to the extent of their respective interests as participators; and so on through other companies. (9) So far as it would go to reduce or extinguish chargeable gains accruing; as a result of this section; to a person in a chargeable period; this section applies to a loss accruing to the company on the disposal of an asset in that period as it would apply if there had been a gain. (10) But (a) this only applies in relation to that person; and (b) this section does not otherwise apply in relation to losses accruing to the company. (11) In this section a non-UK resident close company means a company (a) which is not resident in the United Kingdom; and (b) which would be a close company if it were resident in the United Kingdom. 3AGains connected to avoidance or foreign activities etc (1) A gain accruing to a company on the disposal of an asset is taken to be connected to avoidance unless it is shown that neither (a) the disposal of the asset by the company; nor (b) the acquisition or holding of the asset by the company;formed part of a scheme or arrangements of which the main purpose; or one of the main purposes; was avoidance of liability to capital gains tax or corporation tax. (2) A gain is connected to a foreign trade if it accrues on the disposal of an asset used only (a) for the purposes of a trade carried on by the company wholly outside the United Kingdom; or (b) for the purposes of the foreign part of a trade carried on by the company partly within; and partly outside; the United Kingdom;and the reference here to the foreign part of a trade is to the part of the trade carried on outside the United Kingdom. (3) For this purpose an asset is to be regarded as used only for the purposes of a trade carried on by the company wholly outside the United Kingdom if (a) the asset is accommodation; or an interest or right in accommodation; situated outside the United Kingdom; and (b) the accommodation has for each relevant period been furnished holiday accommodation of which a person has made a commercial letting. (4) Each of the following is a relevant period (a) the period of 12 months ending with the date of the disposal and each of the two preceding periods of 12 months; or (b) if the company has beneficially owned the accommodation (or interest or right) for more than 36 months; the period of 12 months ending with the date of the disposal and each of the preceding periods of 12 months throughout which the company had that beneficial ownership. (5) The reference in this section to the commercial letting of furnished holiday accommodation is to be read in accordance with Chapter 6 of Part 4 of CTA 2009; but as if (a) sections 266; 268 and 268A were omitted; and (b) the reference to an accounting period in section 267 (1) were to a relevant period. (6) A gain accruing on the disposal of an asset is connected to other economically significant foreign activities if (a) the asset is used only for the purposes of activities carried on by the company wholly or mainly outside the United Kingdom; (b) the activities consist of the provision of goods or services on a commercial basis; and (c) the activities also satisfy the staff; premises and economic value test. (7) Activities satisfy the staff; premises and economic value test if they involve (a) the use of employees; agents or contractors of the company in numbers; and with competence and authority; commensurate with the size and nature of the activities; (b) the use of premises and equipment commensurate with the size and nature of the activities; and (c) the addition of economic value by the company to the persons to whom the goods or services are provided commensurate with the size and nature of the activities. (8) This section applies for the purposes of section 3 (1) (b) and (c). 3BParticipators and their interests (1) Participator has the meaning given by section 454 of CTA 2010. (2) Any reference to a persons interest as a participator in a company is to the interest in it represented by all the factors by reference to which the person is a participator. (3) Any reference to the extent of a persons interest as a participator in a company is to such proportion of the interests as participators of all of the companys participators as; on a just and reasonable basis; is represented by that interest. (4) If (a) the interest of a person in a company is wholly or partly represented by an interest under a settlement (the beneficial interest); and (b) the beneficial interest is the factor (or one of them) by reference to which the person would; apart from this subsection; have an interest as a participator in the company;that interest as a participator is; so far as represented by the beneficial interest; to be treated instead as the interest of the trustees of the settlement. (5) If (a) exempt assets of a pension scheme are taken into account in ascertaining a persons interest as a participator in a company; and (b) if those assets were ignored; an amount in respect of a gain accruing to the company would not be apportioned to the person as a result of section 3;no amount in the respect of the gain is to be apportioned to the person as a result of that section. (6) For this purpose (a) assets of a pension scheme means assets held for the purposes of a fund or scheme to which section 271 (1) (c) or (1A) applies; and (b) those assets are exempt if; at the time when the gain accrues; a disposal of those assets would be exempt from tax as a result of either of those provisions. (7) This section applies for the purposes of section 3. Prevention of multiple charges 3CPrevention of double UK taxation (1) If (a) an amount of tax is paid by a person as a result of section 3 in respect of a gain; and (b) there is a distribution of an amount in respect of the gain before the end of the relevant period;the amount of tax is applied so as to reduce or extinguish any liability of the person to tax in respect of the distribution. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (a) the distribution is one made by way of dividend or distribution of capital or on the dissolution of the company; (b) the tax in respect of the distribution is income tax; corporation tax or capital gains tax; and (c) in determining the liability to tax of any individual in respect of any distribution for a tax year it is to be assumed that the distribution is the highest part of the individuals income for the year. (3) For the purposes of subsection (1) the relevant period means the period of 3 years from the end of whichever of the following periods is earlier (a) the period of account of the company in which the gain accrued; and (b) the period of 12 months beginning with the date on which the gain accrued. (4) The amount of tax paid by a person as a result of section 3 is allowable as a deduction in calculating a chargeable gain accruing on the disposal by the person of any asset representing the persons interest as a participator in the company. (5) An amount of tax (a) is not to be used more than once under this section (whether to reduce or extinguish a liability or as a deduction or a combination of those things); and (b) is not to be applied if it is reimbursed by the company. Non-UK domiciled individuals and temporary non-residents 3DNon-UK domiciled individuals (1) This section applies if; as a result of section 3; an amount in respect of a gain accruing to a company in a tax year is apportioned to an individual who is not domiciled in the United Kingdom in that year. (2) The apportioned amount is regarded for the purposes of paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 as accruing on a disposal of a foreign asset if the asset disposed of by the company is a foreign asset (but not otherwise). (3) For the purposes of Chapter A1 of Part 14 of ITA 2007 (remittance basis) (a) treat any consideration obtained by the company on the disposal of the asset as deriving from the apportioned amount; and (b) if that consideration is less than the market value of the asset; treat the asset as deriving from the apportioned amount. (4) The apportioned amount may not be reduced or extinguished by a loss under section 3 if (a) the apportioned amount is regarded for the purposes of paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 as accruing on a disposal of a foreign asset; (b) the remittance basis applies to the individual for the tax year in question; and (c) any of the apportioned amount is remitted to the United Kingdom in a subsequent tax year. (5) Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 applies for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of that Schedule. 3ETemporary non-residents (1) This section applies if (a) an individual is temporarily non-resident; and (b) a gain or loss accrues to a company in a tax year falling wholly or partly in the temporary period of non-residence. (2) So much of the gain as would; as a result of section 3; have been treated as accruing to the individual in the tax year if the residence assumption were made is to be treated as accruing to the individual in the period of return. (3) But if (a) the remittance basis applies to the individual for the tax year that comprises or includes the period of return; and (b) any part of the gain has not been remitted to the United Kingdom before the period of the return;subsection (2) has effect subject to the further application of Schedule 1 (as read with section 3D) in relation to that part of the gain. (4) Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 applies for the purposes of subsection (3) as it applies for the purposes of that Schedule. (5) So much of the loss accruing in the tax year as would; in accordance with section 3 (9); have reduced or extinguished a gain treated as accruing to the individual in that year as a result of section 3 if the residence assumption were made is to be treated as accruing to the individual in the period of return. (6) For the purposes of this section the residence assumption is (a) that the individual was resident in the United Kingdom for the tax year in which the gain or loss accrued to the company; and (b) that the tax year was not a split year as respects the individual. (7) Nothing in any double taxation arrangements prevents a charge to capital gains tax arising as a result of this section. (8) For the purposes of this section each of the following expressions has the meaning given by Part 4 of Schedule 45 to the Finance Act 2013 (statutory residence test: anti-avoidance) the period of returntemporarily non-residentthe temporary period of non-residence.

(2) The gains are treated as accruing to the individual only so far as; and at the time when; they are remitted to the United Kingdom. (3) The amount treated as accruing is equal to the full amount remitted to the United Kingdom at that time. Use of allowable losses against foreign gains remitted in later year2 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) gains are treated as accruing to an individual in a tax year as a result of paragraph 1; (b) the tax year is later than the one (the actual year of accrual) in which those gains actually accrued to the individual; and (c) an election under section 16ZA (election for foreign losses to be allowable losses) has effect for both the tax year and the actual year of accrual.

(3) If allowable losses are matched to chargeable gains accruing on disposals of foreign assets (a) which actually accrue in the tax year; but (b) which are; as a result of paragraph 1; treated as not accruing in the tax year;the amount of those gains is reduced by the matched amount (and the allowable losses are reduced accordingly). (4) So far as allowable losses are matched to other chargeable gains; they are deducted from chargeable gains accruing to the individual in the tax year. (5) This is subject to (a) paragraph 2 (no use of allowable losses against foreign gains remitted in later year); and (b) section 1E (4) (prohibition of deduction of losses from gains treated as accruing under section 87; 87K; 87L or 89 (2) ). Rules for matching losses to chargeable gains4 (1) This paragraph explains how; for the purposes of paragraph 3; allowable losses are matched to chargeable gains in the case of an individual to whom that paragraph applies for a tax year. (2) The losses are matched to the gains in the following orderfirst; gains actually accruing to the individual in the tax year on the disposal of foreign assets so far as they are remitted to the United Kingdom in the tax year;second; gains actually accruing to the individual in the tax year on the disposal of foreign assets so far as they are not remitted to the United Kingdom in the tax year;third; any other gains accruing to the individual in the tax year. (3) If the tax year is a split year; the matching under the first and second steps is to be done by reference to the extent to which the gains are; or are not; remitted in the UK part of the year. (4) If there are losses to be matched to gains under the second step but the losses are insufficient to eliminate the gains (a) the losses are to be matched against gains accruing on the most recent day first (and then the next most recent day and so on until none of the losses remain); and (b) if losses cannot be matched fully against gains accruing on a particular day; the appropriate portion of the losses is matched against each of the gains. (5) The appropriate portion means the amount of each gain accruing on the day divided by the total amount of all of the gains accruing on the day.

PART 2Whether asset derives at least 75% of its value from UK land The basic rule3 (1) An asset derives at least 75% of its value from UK land if (a) the asset consists of a right or an interest in a company; and (b) at the time of the disposal; at least 75% of the total market value of the companys qualifying assets derives (directly or indirectly) from interests in UK land. (2) Market value may be traced through any number of companies; partnerships; trusts and other entities or arrangements but may not be traced through a normal commercial loan.

Meaning of qualifying assets4 (1) Subject as follows; all of the assets of the company are qualifying assets. (2) An asset of the company is not a qualifying asset so far as it is matched to a related party liability. (3) But an interest in UK land is a qualifying asset of the company even if it is matched to any extent to a related party liability. (4) An asset of the company is matched to a related party liability if (a) the asset consists of a right under a transaction (for example; a right under a loan relationship or derivative contract); (b) the right entitles the company to require another person to meet a liability arising under the transaction; and (c) the other person is relevant to the paragraph 3 tracing exercise or is a related party of the company on the day of the disposal. (5) For the purposes of this paragraph a person is relevant to the paragraph 3 tracing exercise if (a) the person has assets that fall to be taken into account in the tracing exercise mentioned in paragraph 3; or (b) the person has obligations (whether as a trustee or otherwise) in relation to the holding of assets comprised in any trust or other arrangement that fall to be taken into account in that exercise. (6) Whether; for the purposes of this paragraph; a person is a related party of the company on any day is determined in accordance with the rules in Part 8ZB of CTA 2010 but as if; in section 356OT (4) of that Act; the words; within the period of 6 months beginning with that day were omitted. (7) In this paragraph a liability includes a contingent liability (such as one arising as a result of the giving of a guarantee; indemnity or other form of financial assistance). Exception in relation to interests in UK land used for trading purposes5 (1) A disposal of a right or interest in a company is not to be regarded as a disposal of an asset deriving at least 75% of its value from UK land if it is reasonable to conclude that; so far as the market value of the companys qualifying assets derives (directly or indirectly) from interests in UK land (a) all of the interests in UK land are used for trading purposes; or (b) all of the interests in UK land would be used for those purposes if low-value non-trade interests in UK land were left out of account. (2) An interest in UK land is used for trading purposes for the purposes of this paragraph if (and only if); at the time of the disposal (a) it is being used in; or for the purposes of; a qualifying trade; or (b) it has been acquired for use in; or for the purposes of; a qualifying trade. (3) A trade is a qualifying trade for the purposes of this paragraph if (a) it has been carried on by the company; or by a person connected with the company; throughout the period of one year ending with the time of the disposal on a commercial basis with a view to the realisation of profits; and (b) it is reasonable to conclude that the trade will continue to be carried on (for more than an insignificant period of time) on a commercial basis with a view to the realisation of profits. (4) For the purposes of this paragraph; low-value non-trade interests in UK land means interests in UK land (a) which are not used for trading purposes; and (b) the total market value of which is; at the time of the disposal; no more than 10% of the total market value at that time of the interests in UK land that are used for trading purposes. Exception for certain disposals of rights or interests under same arrangements etc6 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) there are two or more disposals of rights or interests in companies; (b) the disposals are linked with each other; (c) some but not all of the disposals would; apart from this paragraph; be disposals of assets deriving at least 75% of their value from UK land; and (d) if one of the companies included all of the assets of the others; a disposal of a right or interest in it would not be a disposal of an asset deriving at least 75% of its value from UK land. (2) None of the disposals are to be regarded as disposals of assets deriving at least 75% of their value from UK land. (3) In determining whether the condition in sub-paragraph (1) (d) is met in the case of a disposal of a right or interest in a company; it is to be assumed that; for the purposes of paragraph 4; each of the other companies in which rights or interest are disposed of is (so far as this would not otherwise be the case) a related party of the company on the day of the disposal. (4) For the purposes of this paragraph a disposal of a right or interest in a company is linked with a disposal of a right or interest in another company if (a) the disposals are made under the same arrangements; (b) the disposals are made by the same person or by persons connected with each other; (c) the disposals are made to the same person or to persons connected with each other; and (d) in the case of each disposal; the person making the disposal is connected with the company in which the right or interest is disposed of. (5) For the purposes of this paragraph; the question whether or not a person is connected with another is to be determined immediately before the arrangements are entered into. (6) Section 286 (connected persons: interpretation) has effect for the purposes of this paragraph as if; in subsection (4); the words Except in relation to acquisitions or disposals of partnership assets pursuant to bona fide commercial arrangements; were omitted. Meaning of interest in UK land7For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule interest in UK land has the meaning given by section 1C.

(2) But a person is not to be regarded as having a 25% investment in the company at times falling in the persons qualifying ownership period if; having regard to the length of that period; the times (taken as whole) constitute an insignificant proportion of that period. (3) The persons qualifying ownership period means the period throughout which the person has held an asset consisting of a right or an interest in the company; but excluding times that fall before the beginning of the 2 year period mentioned in sub-paragraph (1). Meaning of 25% investment9 (1) A person (P) has a 25% investment in a company (C) if (a) P possesses or is entitled to acquire 25% or more of the voting power in C; (b) in the event of a disposal of the whole of the equity in C; P would receive 25% or more of the proceeds; (c) in the event that the income in respect of the equity in C were distributed among the equity holders in C; P would receive 25% or more of the amount so distributed; or (d) in the event of a winding-up of C or in any other circumstances; P would receive 25% or more of Cs assets which would then be available for distribution among the equity holders in C in respect of the equity in C.

(3) This exception does not apply if the damage occurred in the course of work that (a) was being done for the purpose of altering the building; and (b) itself involved; or could be expected to involve; making the building unsuitable for use as a dwelling for at least 30 consecutive days. (4) If the exception applies; work done in the 90 day period to restore the building to suitability for use as a dwelling is not to count for the purposes of paragraph 5 as constructing or adapting the building for use as a dwelling.

(2) The application of this Schedule depends on (among other things) whether or not (a) a settlement is for the benefit of a disabled person; and (b) a settlement is a qualifying UK settlement. (3) For the definitions of those expressions; see paragraphs 3 and 7 respectively. (4) In this Schedule any reference to the application of section 1K in relation to an individual for a tax year is to its application in relation to an individual who is resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom for the year. Settlements for the benefit of disabled persons2 (1) In the case of a settlement for the benefit of a disabled person for a tax year; section 1K applies in relation to the trustees of the settlement for the year as it applies in relation to an individual for the year. (2) This paragraph needs to be read with (a) paragraph 6 (cases where settlement is a qualifying UK settlement comprised in a group); and (b) paragraph 8 (sub-fund settlements). 3 (1) A settlement is a settlement for the benefit of a disabled person for a tax year if; for the whole or part of that year; settled property is held on trusts which secure that; during the lifetime of a disabled person; the property and income tests are met. (2) The property test is met if any of the property which is applied for the benefit of a beneficiary is applied for the disabled persons benefit. (3) The income test is met if either (a) the disabled person is entitled to all of the income (if any) arising from any of the property; or (b) if any income arising from any of the property is applied for the benefit of a beneficiary; it is applied for the disabled persons benefit. (4) A settlement is not prevented from being a settlement for the benefit of a disabled person for a tax year just because (a) the trustees have power to apply amounts (of any nature) not exceeding the de minimis threshold for that year; (b) the trustees have the powers of advancement conferred by section 32 of the Trustee Act 1925 or section 33 of the Trustee Act (Northern Ireland) 1958; (c) the trustees have those powers but free from; or subject to a less restrictive limitation than; the limitation imposed by (i) proviso (a) of section 32 (1) of the Trustee Act 1925; or (ii) section 33 (1) (a) of the Trustee Act (Northern Ireland) 1958; or (d) the trustees have powers to the same effect as the powers mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c). (5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4) (a) the de minimis threshold means (a) 3;000; or (b) 3% of the maximum value of the settled property during the tax year;whichever is the lower. (6) In this paragraph disabled person has the meaning given by Schedule 1A to the Finance Act 2005. (7) If the income from settled property is held for the benefit of a disabled person (D) on trusts of the kind described in section 33 of the Trustee Act 1925 (protective trusts); the reference in this paragraph to Ds lifetime is to be read as a reference to the period during which the income is held on trust for D. (8) This paragraph applies for the purposes of this Schedule. 4 (1) The Treasury may by order (a) specify circumstances in which paragraph 3 (4) (a) is; or is not; to apply; and (b) amend the definition of the de minimis threshold in paragraph 3 (5). (2) The order may (a) make different provision for different purposes; and (b) contain transitional and saving provision. (3) A statutory instrument containing an order under this paragraph which reduces the annual exempt amount in any case may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before; and approved by a resolution of; the House of Commons. Other settlements5 (1) This paragraph applies if settlement is not a settlement for the benefit of a disabled person for a tax year. (2) Section 1K applies in relation to the trustees of the settlement for the year as it applies in relation to an individual for the year but as if the annual exempt amount for the year were one-half of the amount available for the individual for the year. (3) This paragraph needs to be read be with (a) paragraph 6 (cases where settlement is qualifying UK settlement comprised in a group); and (b) paragraph 8 (sub-fund settlements). Special rules for qualifying UK settlements comprised in groups6 (1) This paragraph reduces the annual exempt amount for trustees of a settlement for a tax year if the settlement is one of two or more qualifying UK settlements comprised in a group. (2) In the case of a settlement for the benefit of a disabled person for the year; the annual exempt amount for the year is to be reduced so that it is equal to (a) one-tenth of an individuals amount for that year; or (b) the amount resulting from dividing the individuals amount for that year by the number of settlements in the group;whichever is the greater. (3) In the case of any other settlement; the annual exempt amount for the year is to be reduced so that it is equal to (a) one-tenth of an individuals amount for that year; or (b) the amount resulting from dividing half of an individuals amount for that year by the number of settlements in the group;whichever is the greater. (4) In this paragraph an individuals amount; in relation to a tax year; means the annual exempt amount applying to an individual for the year under section 1K. (5) For the purposes of this paragraph all qualifying UK settlements in relation to which the same person is the settlor constitute a group. (6) If (a) two or more persons are settlors in relation to a settlement; and (b) a settlement is consequently comprised in two or more groups comprising different numbers of settlement;sub-paragraphs (2) (b) and (3) (b) have effect by reference to the largest group. 7 (1) In this Schedule qualifying UK settlement; in relation to a tax year; means any settlement in relation to which both of the following conditions are met (a) the trustees of the settlement are resident in the United Kingdom during any part of the tax year; and (b) the property comprised in the settlement is not held for a charitable or pensions purpose. (2) Property comprised in a settlement is held for a charitable purpose if (and only if) (a) it is held for charitable purposes only; and (b) it cannot become applicable for other purposes. (3) Property comprised in a settlement is held for a pensions purpose if (and only if) it is held for the purposes of (a) a registered pension scheme; (b) a superannuation fund to which section 615 (3) of the Taxes Act applies; or (c) an occupational pension scheme (within the meaning of section 150 (5) of the Finance Act 2004) that is not a registered pension scheme. (4) For this purposes of any provision of this Schedule other than paragraph 8 a settlement is not a qualifying UK settlement if (a) in the case of one for the benefit of a disabled person; it was made before 10 March 1981; or (b) in any other case; it was made before 6 June 1978. Special rules for principal settlements and sub-funds8 (1) This paragraph (a) applies if the trustees of a settlement (the principal settlement) have made an election under paragraph 1 of Schedule 4ZA the effect of which is that one or more other settlements (sub-fund settlements) are treated as created; and (b) provides for the annual exempt for the trustees of each of the affected settlements to be determined by reference to the assumed annual amount. (2) For this purposes of this paragraph (a) the principal settlement and each of the sub-fund settlements is an affected settlement; and (b) the assumed annual amount means the amount which would be the annual exempt for the trustees of the principal settlement on the assumption that no election had been made under paragraph 1 of Schedule 4ZA. (3) The annual exempt amount for the trustees of each of the affected settlements is the assumed annual amount unless there are two or more qualifying UK settlements in the affected settlements. (4) In that case; the annual exempt amount for the trustees of each of the affected settlements is the assumed annual amount divided by the number of qualifying UK settlements in the affected settlements. 17After Schedule 4 insert SCHEDULE 4AARe-basing for non-residents in respect of UK land etc held on 5 April 2019 PART 1Introduction1 (1) Part 2; 3 or 4 of this Schedule applies on the first occasion on which a person disposes of an asset that the person held on 5 April 2019 where (a) the disposal is either a direct or indirect disposal of UK land; and (b) the disposal is made by a non-resident or a UK resident in the overseas part of a tax year.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph; the disposal is made by a non-resident or a UK resident in the overseas part of a tax year if it is (a) a disposal on which a gain accrues that falls to be dealt with by section 1A (3) because the asset disposed of is within paragraph (b) or (c) of that subsection; (b) a disposal on which a gain accrues that falls to be dealt with by section 1A (1) in accordance with section 1G (2) because the asset disposed of is within section 1A (3) (b) or (c); (c) a disposal on which a gain accrues that falls to be dealt with by section 2B (4); or (d) a disposal of an asset on which a gain does not accrue but which; had a gain accrued; would fall to be dealt with as mentioned in any of the preceding paragraphs of this sub-paragraph.

(7) In determining for the purposes of this paragraph whether or not (a) a person is a closely-held company; or (b) a person is a widely-marketed scheme;arrangements are to be ignored if the main purpose of; or one of the main purposes of; them is to secure a tax advantage as a result of the person not being a closely-held company or the person being a widely-marketed scheme.

Meaning of a collective investment vehicle being UK property rich etc3 (1) For the purposes of this Schedule the question whether a collective investment vehicle is UK property rich at any time is determined by applying the rules in Part 2 of Schedule 1A on the following assumptions. (2) The assumptions are (a) that (so far as this would not otherwise be the case) the vehicle were a company; and (b) that a disposal were made at that time of a right or interest in that company. (3) If that disposal would be regarded for the purposes of Schedule 1A as a disposal of an asset deriving at least 75% of its value from UK land; the vehicle is regarded for the purposes of this Schedule as being UK property rich at that time. (4) For the purposes of this Schedule the question whether a company is UK property rich at any time is determined by applying the rules in Part 2 of Schedule 1A on the assumption that a disposal were made at that time of a right or interest in the company. (5) If that disposal would be regarded for the purposes of Schedule 1A as a disposal of an asset deriving at least 75% of its value from UK land; the company is regarded for the purposes of this Schedule as being UK property rich at that time. PART 2Basic rules Application of Act to offshore CIV4 (1) This paragraph applies to an offshore collective investment vehicle (a) which is not a company; and (b) which is not constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership. (2) It is to be assumed that; for relevant purposes (a) the vehicle is a company; and (b) the rights of the participants are shares in that company. (3) The reference here to relevant purposes means (a) the purposes of this Schedule; and (b) the purpose of applying section 1A (3) (b) or (c) or 2B (4) (and the other provisions of this or any other Act so far as relevant to their application) in relation to the vehicle. (4) This paragraph does not apply to a collective investment vehicle in relation to which an election has effect under Part 3 of this Schedule (election for transparency). (5) This paragraph applies in relation to a collective investment vehicle to which section 103D applies (tax transparent funds) but does not affect the operation of the rules set out in (a) section 103D (4) to (9) (calculation of gains on disposal of units etc); or (b) section 103DA (share pooling etc). (6) If this paragraph applies in relation to a collective investment vehicle; section 99 (application of Act to unit trust schemes) does not apply in relation to the scheme. Units in a CoACS treated as shares in a company5 (1) This paragraph applies to a unit in an authorised contractual scheme which is a co-ownership scheme where; as a result of the application of section 103D (application of Act to tax transparent funds); the unit is treated as an asset for the purposes of this Act. (2) The asset is treated for the purposes of Schedule 1A as if it were a share in a company. Disposals by non-UK residents6 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) a person disposes of an asset that derives at least 75% of its value from UK land (as determined in accordance with Part 2 of Schedule 1A); and (b) the disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle (see sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) for the cases in which this test is met). (2) For the purposes of section 1A (3) (c) or 2B (4) (b) (disposals by non-UK residents of assets deriving 75% of value from UK land etc); the person is treated as having a substantial indirect interest in the UK land at the time of the disposal. (3) A disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle if the asset disposed of consists of a right or interest in (a) a collective investment vehicle; or (b) a company at least half of whose market value derives from its being a direct or indirect participant in one or more collective investment vehicles. (4) A disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle if (a) the vehicle is constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership; and (b) the disposal is made by a person as a participant in the vehicle. (5) A disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle if the vehicle is a company and the disposal is made by it. (6) A disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle if (a) a company (which is not the vehicle) makes the disposal; and (b) the vehicle; and one or more other collective investment vehicles that are UK property rich; have a 50% investment in the company. (7) Collective investment vehicles have a 50% investment in a company if; applying the rule in paragraph 9 (but without regard to paragraph 10) of Schedule 1A as if references to 25% were references to 50%; the vehicles would be regarded as having a 50% investment in the company at the time of the disposal. (8) For this purpose the collective investment schemes are to be regarded as if they were a single person. (9) This paragraph is subject to paragraph 7 (collective investment vehicles expected to have no more than 40% investments in UK land). 7 (1) This paragraph applies to a disposal which would otherwise have an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle as a result of paragraph 6 (3); (5) or (6). (2) A disposal does not have an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle if; at the time of the disposal; the vehicle mentioned in paragraph 6 (3) (a) or (5) or (6); or each of the vehicles mentioned in paragraph 6 (3) (b); meets (a) the non-UK real estate condition; and (b) the genuine diversity of ownership condition or; if the vehicle is a company; the non-close condition. (3) If (a) a disposal is made as mentioned in paragraph 6 (6); and (b) the vehicle mentioned there is constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership;the condition in sub-paragraph (2) (b) is taken to be met if the company mentioned in paragraph 6 (6) meets the non-close condition. (4) A vehicle meets the non-UK real estate condition at any time if; by reference to the prospectus for the vehicle as the prospectus has effect at that time; no more than 40% of the expected market value of the vehicles investments is intended to derive from investments consisting of (a) interests in UK land; or (b) rights or interests in companies which are UK property rich. (5) A vehicle meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition at any time if; at that time (a) it meets conditions A to C of regulation 75 of the Offshore Funds (Tax) Regulations 2009; or (b) it meets the condition in regulation 75 (5) of those Regulations;and those Regulations apply for the purposes of this sub-paragraph as if any collective investment vehicle which is not an offshore fund were regarded as an offshore fund. (6) A company meets the non-close condition at any time if; at that time; it (a) is not a close company; or (b) is a close company but only because it has a qualifying investor as a direct or indirect participator. (7) Paragraph 46 (meaning of close company; qualifying investor and direct or indirect participator) applies for the purposes of sub-paragraph (6). PART 3Election for transparency Election for collective investment vehicle to be treated as partnership8 (1) This paragraph applies to an offshore collective investment vehicle (a) which is UK property rich; and (b) which is transparent for income tax purposes otherwise than as a result of being constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership. (2) The manager of the vehicle may make an election for the vehicle to be treated for the purposes of (a) this Act; and (b) the Management Act; and any other provision of the Corporation Tax Acts; so far as relating to the taxation of chargeable gains;as if; in relation to all times on and after its constitution; it were to be regarded as a partnership. (3) Accordingly; as a result of sub-paragraph (2) (b); it follows that; in applying rules such as section 1154 of CTA 2010 (meaning of 75% subsidiary etc) for the purposes of Part 12 of that Act (Real Estate Investment Trusts) so far as relating to the taxation of chargeable gains; the vehicle is to be regarded as a partnership. (4) In the case of section 12AA of the Management Act as it applies as a result of sub-paragraph (2); a notice under subsection (2) or (3) of that section may be given to the manager of the vehicle. (5) The election has effect whether or not the vehicle would; but for the making of the election; be regarded as a person chargeable to capital gains tax or corporation tax on chargeable gains. (6) For the purposes of this paragraph whether or not an offshore collective investment vehicle is regarded as being UK property rich may be determined by reference to the prospectus for the vehicle on the assumption that investments are made by the vehicle in accordance with the prospectus. (7) For the purposes of this paragraph a collective investment vehicle is transparent for income tax purposes if; on the assumption that there are participants who are individuals resident in the United Kingdom; any sums which form part of the income of the vehicle (a) would be chargeable to income tax on those assumed participants under a provision specified in section 830 (2) of ITTOIA 2005 in respect of such of those sums as would be referable to their interests; or (b) if any of that income is derived from assets within the United Kingdom; would be so chargeable had the assets been outside the United Kingdom. (8) If an election is made under this paragraph in relation to a collective investment vehicle (a) section 99 (application of Act to unit trust schemes) does not apply in relation to the vehicle; and (b) section 103D (tax transparent funds) does not apply in relation to the vehicle. Further provision about election9 (1) An election under paragraph 8 in relation to an offshore collective investment vehicle (a) has effect only if the participants in the vehicle at the time at which it is made have consented to the making of the election; (b) must be made by notice given to an officer of Revenue and Customs; and (c) must be made before the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the relevant acquisition date. (2) For this purpose the relevant acquisition date means the earliest date on which (a) an interest in UK land; or (b) a right or interest in a company that is UK property rich;forms part of the property that is the subject of or held by the vehicle. (3) An election under paragraph 8 is irrevocable. Units in CIVs held by life insurance companies10 (1) This paragraph applies if an election under paragraph 8 has effect in relation to an offshore collective investment vehicle. (2) The election is treated as having no effect for the purposes of this Act in relation to any units in the vehicle which are held by an insurance company for the purposes of its long-term business. Relationship to re-basing rules under Schedule 4AA for non-UK residents11 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 8 has effect in relation to an offshore collective investment vehicle; and (b) as a result of the election; Part 3 or 4 of Schedule 4AA would (but for this paragraph) apply in relation to a disposal made by a participant in the vehicle. (2) The disposal is to be regarded for the purposes of Schedule 4AA as if it were one to which Part 2 of that Schedule applies. PART 4Exemption Exemption for qualifying offshore CIV that is UK property rich etc12 (1) An election may be made for a collective investment vehicle; or a company which is not a collective investment vehicle; to be exempt from corporation tax on chargeable gains accruing to it on (a) all direct disposals of UK land; and (b) all indirect disposals of UK land. (2) An election may be made in respect of a collective investment vehicle if each of the following entitlement conditions is met (a) the vehicle is offshore; (b) the vehicle is a company (whether as a result of paragraph 4 or otherwise); (c) the vehicle is UK property rich; (d) the vehicle meets all of the qualifying conditions set out in paragraph 13; and (e) if the vehicle is an AIF; it would also meet the definition of a collective investment vehicle for another reason. (3) An election may be made in respect of a company which is not a collective investment vehicle if each of the following entitlement conditions is met (a) the company is wholly (or almost wholly) owned by a collective investment scheme which is constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership or is constituted by a CoACS; (b) the appropriate entity is UK property rich; and (c) the company meets all of the qualifying conditions set out in paragraph 13;and it does not matter where the company is resident. (4) In sub-paragraph (3) (b) the appropriate entity means (a) in a case where the collective investment scheme is constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership; the company; and (b) in a case where the collective investment scheme is constituted by a CoACS; the CoACS. (5) If an election is made under this paragraph in respect of a collective investment vehicle (a) the vehicle is referred to in this Part of this Schedule as a qualifying fund; and (b) any reference in this Part of this Schedule to a qualifying fund; in relation to any time after the election is made (including any time after the election ceases to have effect); is to be read as a reference to the arrangements; undertaking or company which met the definition of collective investment vehicle when the election was made. (6) If an election is made under this paragraph in respect of a company which is not a collective investment vehicle (a) the company is referred to in this Part of this Schedule as a qualifying company; and (b) any reference in this Part of this Schedule to a qualifying company; in relation to any time after the election is made (including any time after the election ceases to have effect); is to be read as a reference to the company. (7) Section 103D (application of Act to tax transparent funds) does not apply for the purpose of determining whether sub-paragraph (3) (a) applies. (8) In this paragraphAIF has the meaning given by regulation 3 of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013; andCoACS means an authorised contractual scheme which is a co-ownership scheme. Qualifying conditions and information provided to HMRC13 (1) For the purposes of paragraph 12 (2); a collective investment vehicle meets the qualifying conditions in this paragraph at any time if; at that time (a) it is a collective investment scheme and it meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition; (b) it is a company (otherwise than as a result of paragraph 4) and it meets the recognised stock exchange condition and the non-close condition; or (c) it is a collective investment vehicle (of any kind) and it meets the UK tax condition and the non-close condition. (2) For the purposes of paragraph 12 (3); a company which is not a collective investment vehicle meets the qualifying conditions in this paragraph at any time if; at that time; either (a) the company meets the UK tax condition and the non-close condition; or (b) the collective investment scheme which wholly (or almost wholly) owns the company meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition. (3) For the purposes of this paragraph a collective investment scheme meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition at any time if; at that time (a) it meets conditions A to C of regulation 75 of the Offshore Funds (Tax) Regulations 2009; or (b) it meets the condition in regulation 75 (5) of those Regulations;and those Regulations apply for the purposes of this sub-paragraph as if any collective investment scheme which is not an offshore fund were regarded as an offshore fund. (4) For the purposes of this paragraph a company meets the recognised stock exchange condition at any time if; at that time (a) it has ordinary share capital; and (b) the shares forming part of its ordinary share capital are regularly traded on a recognised stock exchange. (5) For the purposes of this paragraph a company meets the non-close condition at any time if; at that time; it (a) is not a close company; or (b) is a close company but only because it has a qualifying investor as a direct or indirect participator. (6) Paragraph 46 (meaning of close company; qualifying investor and direct or indirect participator) applies for the purposes of sub-paragraph (5). (7) For the purposes of this paragraph a company meets the UK tax condition at any time if; on the assumption that all of the shares in it were disposed of for their market value at that time; the person making the election reasonably considers at that time that; as a result solely of double taxation arrangements; no more than 25% of the total proceeds would fall to be left out of account for the purposes of this Act. 14 (1) An election under paragraph 12 has effect only if it is accompanied by information of such description as may be specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs about disposals made by participants in the relevant fund at any time in (a) the period of two years ending with the day before the day on which the election is made; or (b) if shorter; the period beginning with the constitution of the relevant fund and ending with the day before the day on which the election is made. (2) Information is not required by sub-paragraph (1) to accompany the election so far as (a) it has already been provided to an officer of Revenue and Customs in a form and manner; and at times; specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs; and (b) the election sets out those occasions on which the information has been so provided. 15 (1) An election under paragraph 12 has effect subject to such conditions as to the provision of information or documents to an officer of Revenue and Customs as may be specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs. (2) The information or documents must be provided to an officer of Revenue and Customs in respect of every period of account of the relevant fund which ends at a time when the election has effect. (3) The information or documents must be provided to an officer of Revenue and Customs within the period of 12 months from the end of the period of account. (4) The conditions as to the provision of information or documents may include (a) conditions relating to the participants in the relevant fund; and (b) conditions requiring information or documents in respect of the operation of any provision of this Schedule (or any provision of this Act relevant to this Schedule). (5) In the case of an election under paragraph 12 (a) a designated HMRC officer may revoke the election if; in the officers opinion; there has been; without reasonable excuse; a breach of any provision made by or under this paragraph; but (b) an officer of Revenue and Customs (whether or not designated) may waive a breach of any provision made by or under this paragraph if; in the officers opinion; there is no reasonable excuse for the breach but; having regard to all the circumstances; the breach is nonetheless insignificant. (6) The circumstances to which the officer may have regard in determining whether a breach is insignificant include the number and seriousness of previous breaches. (7) In this paragraph period of account; in relation to the relevant fund; means any period for which accounts of the relevant fund are drawn up. (8) If the period of account would otherwise be longer than 12 months; the period of account is to be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as split into more than one period of account; and (a) the first deemed period of account is to be 12 months long; and (b) any subsequent deemed period of account is to start when the previous deemed period of account ends and is to end 12 months later or; if earlier; when the actual period of account ends. Exemption for direct or indirect disposals of UK land by persons in which fund invests16 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 12 has been made in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company (Q); (b) Q is UK property rich by reference (wholly or partly) to particular interests in UK land (the relevant UK property); and (c) a person other than Q makes a disposal at a time when the election has effect. (2) If (a) the disposal is a direct disposal of any of the relevant UK property by a person; and (b) immediately before the disposal; Q has a 40% investment in the person;the appropriate proportion of any gain accruing to the person on the disposal is not a chargeable gain. (3) If the disposal is an indirect disposal of UK land in a case where (a) the interests in UK land in question consist of or include any of the relevant UK property; and (b) immediately before the disposal; Q has a 40% investment in the company in question;the appropriate proportion of any gain accruing to the person on the disposal is not a chargeable gain. (4) For the purposes of this paragraph the appropriate proportion means the proportion that so much of the consideration for the disposal as forms part (directly or indirectly) of the assets of Q bears to the total consideration for the disposal. (5) For the purposes of this paragraph a person has a 40% investment in a company if; applying the rule in paragraph 9 (but without regard to paragraph 10) of Schedule 1A as if references to 25% were references to 40%; the person would be regarded as having a 40% investment in the company immediately before the disposal. (6) In this paragraphthe interests in UK land in question means the interests in UK land taken into account in determining whether the disposal is an indirect disposal of UK land; andthe company in question; in relation to a disposal of a right or interest in a company by the person; means that company. (7) If an officer of Revenue and Customs considers that the operation of this paragraph would otherwise result in the total proportion of a gain that is not a chargeable gain exceeding the whole of the gain; the officer may make such adjustments to the appropriate proportion of a gain accruing to any person as the officer considers just and reasonable to prevent that result. Making of election and period for which it has effect17 (1) An election under paragraph 12 (a) must be made by the relevant fund manager; and (b) must be made by notice given to an officer of Revenue and Customs. (2) An election under paragraph 12 must specify the day from which it is to have effect. (3) The election has effect in relation to disposals on or after the day specified in the election. (4) A day may be specified in the election even if it falls before the day on which the election is made. (5) But a day that falls more than 12 months before the day on which the election is made may be specified only if an officer of Revenue and Customs consents. (6) For this purpose (a) consent may be given generally (for example; by describing; in a notice published by an officer of Revenue and Customs; cases in which consent is deemed to be given); or (b) consent may be given in relation to particular cases. Revocation of election18 (1) In addition to the case set out in paragraph 15 (5) (a); a designated HMRC officer may revoke an election under paragraph 12 if; in order to safeguard the public revenue; the officer considers it is appropriate to revoke the election. (2) In the case of an election under paragraph 12 which is revoked by a designated HMRC officer (whether under this paragraph or paragraph 15); the revocation must be made by notice given by a designated HMRC officer to the relevant fund manager. (3) The relevant fund manager may revoke an election under paragraph 12 by giving notice of the revocation to an officer of Revenue and Customs. (4) A notice of revocation of an election under paragraph 12 must specify the day from which the election is to cease to have effect. (5) The election ceases to have effect in relation to disposals made on or after the day specified in the notice of revocation. (6) The relevant fund manager may specify a day in a notice of revocation even if the day falls before the day on which the notice is given but only if an officer of Revenue and Customs consent. (7) For this purpose (a) consent may be given generally (for example; by describing; in a notice published by an officer of Revenue and Customs; cases in which consent is deemed to be given); or (b) consent may be given in relation to particular cases. 19 (1) A notice of revocation given by a designated HMRC officer under paragraph 15 or 18 must state the grounds for revoking the election under paragraph 12. (2) The relevant fund manager may bring an appeal against the revocation of the election. (3) The appeal must be made by notice given to the designated HMRC officer during the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the notice of revocation is given. (4) In the case of an appeal which is notified to the tribunal (see Part 5 of the Management Act); the tribunal must not allow the appeal unless it considers that a designated HMRC officer could not reasonably have been satisfied that there were grounds for revoking the election. Qualifying fund or company ceasing to meet applicable exemption conditions20 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 12 has been made at any time in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company; and (b) at any subsequent time; the qualifying fund or qualifying company ceases to meet the applicable exemption conditions. (2) The election ceases to have effect from that subsequent time in relation to disposals made at or after that time. (3) This paragraph needs to be read with (a) paragraph 27 (temporary period of no more than 30 days during which certain of applicable exemption conditions not met); (b) paragraph 28 (temporary period of no more than 9 months during which applicable exemption conditions not met); and (c) paragraph 30 (steps taken by relevant fund manager to wind up relevant fund). Deemed disposal: payments not otherwise taxable where value derived from direct or indirect disposals of UK land21 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 12 that has been made in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company has effect at any time; (b) a participant in the relevant fund is entitled to receive an amount at that time (the relevant time) which represents; in substance; value derived (directly or indirectly) from a direct disposal of UK land or from the UK land component of an indirect disposal of UK land; and (c) the amount is regarded as being of a revenue nature and does not fall to be taken into account for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax on income. (2) In the case of an election made in respect of a qualifying fund; the participant in the relevant fund is deemed for the purposes of this Act (a) to have sold its units in the relevant fund immediately before the relevant time at their market value immediately before that time; and (b) to have reacquired those units immediately after the relevant time at their market value immediately after that time. (3) In the case of an election made in respect of a qualifying company; the participant in the relevant fund is deemed for the purposes of this Act (a) to have sold its rights and interests in the company immediately before the relevant time at their market value immediately before that time; and (b) to have reacquired those rights and interests immediately after the relevant time at their market value immediately after that time. (4) In this paragraph the UK land component of an indirect disposal of UK land means the interests in UK land taken into account in determining whether the disposal is an indirect disposal of UK land. Deemed disposal if election ceases to have effect22 (1) This paragraph applies if at any time an election which has been made under paragraph 12 in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company ceases to have effect. (2) In the case of an election made in respect of a qualifying fund; each participant in the relevant fund is deemed for the purposes of this Act (a) to have sold its units in the relevant fund immediately before that time; and (b) to have immediately reacquired those rights and interests;at their market value immediately before that time. (3) In the case of an election made in respect of a qualifying company; each participant in the relevant fund is deemed for the purposes of this Act (a) to have sold its rights and interests in the company immediately before that time; and (b) to have immediately reacquired those rights and interests;at their market value immediately before that time. Gains accruing on disposals under paragraph 21 or 2223 (1) This paragraph applies if a disposal of an asset is deemed to have been made by a person at any time under (a) paragraph 21; or (b) paragraph 22 but only as a result of paragraph 20 (qualifying fund or qualifying company ceasing to meet the applicable exemption conditions). (2) Any gain (the deemed gain) accruing to the person on the disposal is treated as accruing to the person in accordance with the rules set out in the remainder of this paragraph. (3) If; at the time of the deemed disposal or a subsequent time (a) the person actually disposes of a unit in the relevant fund; or (b) the person receives an amount of a kind mentioned in paragraph 21 (1);the appropriate portion of the deemed gain is treated as accruing to the person at the time of the actual disposal or the time of the receipt. (4) For this purpose the appropriate portion means the proportion which (a) the consideration for the actual disposal; or (b) the amount of the receipt;bears to the amount of the deemed gain. (5) If some of the deemed gain has accrued on one or more previous occasions; the appropriate portion is restricted so that; when added to the appropriate portion or portions on the previous occasion or occasions; it does not exceed 100%. (6) In determining the appropriate proportion; so much (if any) of the consideration for the actual disposal or the amount of the receipt as exceeds the amount of the deemed gain is to be ignored. (7) In the case of a disposal under paragraph 21; the remainder of the deemed gain is treated as accruing to the person (unless the whole amount has already accrued) when the relevant fund is wound up. (8) In the case of a disposal under paragraph 22; the remainder of the deemed gain is treated as accruing to the person (unless the whole amount has already accrued) at (a) the end of the period of three years beginning with the time of the deemed disposal; or (b) if earlier; when the relevant fund is wound up. Relief for expenses in the case of deemed disposals under paragraph 21 or 2224 (1) This paragraph applies if a disposal is deemed to have been made by a person as a result of paragraph 21 or 22. (2) The person is treated for the purposes of section 38 (1) (c) as having incurred incidental costs of making the deemed disposal equal to the notional costs. (3) The reference here to the notional costs is to the incidental costs (a) which the person would reasonably have expected to have incurred if the deemed sale under paragraph 21 or 22 had been an actual sale; and (b) which would have been allowable under section 38 (1) (c) if there had been an actual sale. Notification to participants in relation to deemed disposals under paragraph 21 or 2225 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) a disposal is deemed to have been made by a person under paragraph 21; (b) a disposal is deemed to have been made by a person under paragraph 22 as a result of the revocation of an election; or (c) an amount is treated as accruing to a person under paragraph 23 (7) or (8).

(2) If (a) there is a failure to comply with that paragraph; and (b) there are two or more persons who are the relevant fund managers each of whom is subject to the duty to notify under that paragraph;the total amount of the penalties to which those managers (taken together) are liable is not to exceed 3;000. (3) If a person becomes liable to a penalty under this paragraph; an officer of Revenue and Customs must (a) assess the penalty; and (b) notify the person. (4) The assessment must be made within the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which an officer of Revenue and Customs first becomes aware that the person has failed to comply with paragraph 25. (5) A person may; by notice; appeal against a decision of an officer of Revenue and Customs that a penalty is payable under this paragraph. (6) Notice of appeal under this paragraph must specify the grounds of appeal. (7) Notice of appeal under this paragraph must be given (a) within 30 days after the penalty was notified to the person; (b) to the officer of Revenue and Customs who notified the person. (8) A penalty under this paragraph must be paid before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with (a) the day on which the person was notified of the penalty; or (b) if notice of appeal against the penalty is given; the day on which the appeal is finally determined or withdrawn. Temporary period during which applicable exemption conditions not met27 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 12 has been made in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company (Q); (b) Q ceases at any time (the relevant time) to meet the applicable exemption conditions otherwise than as a result of the vehicle or appropriate entity ceasing to be UK property rich (see paragraph 12 (2) (c) or (3) (b) ); (c) the election would (but for this paragraph) have; accordingly; ceased to have had effect under paragraph 20 from the relevant time; (d) the relevant fund manager expects Q to meet the applicable exemption conditions within 30 days; and (e) Q does meets those conditions within 30 days. (2) The failure by Q to meet the applicable exemption conditions is to be ignored for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule. (3) In this paragraph any reference to Q meeting the applicable exemption conditions within 30 days is to Q meeting those conditions before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the relevant time falls. (4) This paragraph does not apply on more than four occasions in any period of 12 months. 28 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 12 has been made in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company; (b) but for this paragraph; the election would; as a result of paragraph 20; have ceased to have effect from a particular time for all purposes of this Part of this Schedule (the relevant time); (c) the relevant fund manager expects the failure to meet the applicable exemption conditions to last for a temporary period; and (d) at the end of the temporary period; the qualifying fund or qualifying company does meet those conditions. (2) It is to be assumed that; for the purposes of any provision of this Part of this Schedule other than paragraph 22; the qualifying fund or qualifying company continues to meet the applicable exemption conditions during the temporary period. (3) Accordingly (a) a deemed disposal occurs under paragraph 22 by reference to the failure to meet the applicable exemption conditions; but (b) subject to that; the election continues to have effect during the temporary period. (4) A period is not to be regarded as a temporary period for the purposes of this paragraph if it is longer than a period of 9 months beginning with the relevant time. (5) This paragraph does not apply if paragraph 27 applies. 29 (1) This paragraph applies if paragraph 28 has applied in relation to a qualifying fund or qualifying company on one or more occasions. (2) Paragraph 23 (8) has effect as if; for the words from at to the end; there were substituted when the relevant fund is wound up.

(2) It is to be assumed that; for the purposes of any provision of this Part of this Schedule other than paragraph 22; the qualifying fund or qualifying company continues to meet the applicable exemption conditions until the relevant fund is wound up. (3) Accordingly (a) a deemed disposal occurs under paragraph 22 by reference to the failure to meet the applicable exemption conditions; but (b) subject to that; the election continues to have effect until the relevant fund is wound up. Deemed disposals of UK land by companies previously owned by fund31 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 12 has been made in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company (Q); (b) Q; or a company covered by the election; disposes of all of its rights and interests in another company (C) which is UK property rich; and (c) C is covered by the election. (2) C is deemed for the purposes of this Act (a) to have sold; at the relevant time; the appropriate proportion of every qualifying asset the actual disposal of which by C would be a direct or indirect disposal of UK land; and (b) to have reacquired the appropriate proportion of the asset immediately after the relevant time;at its market value at the relevant time. (3) In the case of a disposal; a company is covered by the election for the purposes of this paragraph if the disposal is one to which paragraph 16 applies where the election concerned is the one referred to in this paragraph. (4) For the purposes of this paragraph the appropriate proportion of an asset is equal to whatever would be; for the purposes of paragraph 16; the appropriate portion of any gain if it is assumed (a) that C had sold the asset at the relevant time; and (b) that the total consideration for that sale was such that it results in a gain of 100 accruing to C. (5) For the purposes of this paragraph; an asset is a qualifying asset if; throughout the period of one year ending with the day on which the disposal of the asset is made; the asset has been held by C or any other company covered by the election or by Q. (6) In this paragraph the relevant time means the time immediately before the disposal of all the rights and interests in C.

(2) Q is deemed for the purposes of this Act (a) to have sold; at the relevant time; every asset the actual disposal of which by Q would be a direct or indirect disposal of UK land; and (b) to have reacquired the asset immediately after the relevant time;at its market value at the relevant time. (3) In the case of any asset covered by the election for 12 months and held by a company at the relevant time; the company is deemed for the purposes of this Act (a) to have sold; at the relevant time; the appropriate proportion of the asset; and (b) to have reacquired the appropriate proportion of the asset immediately after the relevant time;at its market value at the relevant time. (4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) an asset held by a company at the relevant time has been covered by the election for 12 months if; assuming the asset were disposed of at the relevant time; the disposal would have been one to which paragraph 16 applied by reference to the election. (5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) the appropriate proportion of an asset is equal to whatever would be; for the purposes of paragraph 16; the appropriate portion of any gain if it is assumed (a) that the company had sold the asset at the relevant time; and (b) that the total consideration for that sale was such that it results in a gain of 100 accruing to it. (6) For the purposes of this paragraph the election ceases to have effect in disqualifying circumstances if (a) it ceases to have effect as a result of a notice of revocation under paragraph 15 (5) (a) in a case where a designated officer of Revenue and Customs is of the opinion that there have been at least three serious breaches of provision made by or under paragraph 15 during the period for which the election has had effect; or (b) it ceases to have effect as a result of a notice of revocation under paragraph 18 (1). (7) In this paragraph the relevant time means the time immediately before (a) the election ceases to have effect; or (b) the relevant fund manager starts to take steps with a view to the disposal of all or the assets of the relevant fund so that it can be wound up. (8) For the purposes of this paragraph an election made under paragraph 12 in respect of Q is taken to be the same election as one made at a subsequent time in respect of another qualifying fund or qualifying company (A) if; at the subsequent time; Q is wholly owned by A. Exemption for disposals by companies wholly owned by certain investors33 (1) This paragraph applies if an election under paragraph 12 has been made in respect of a qualifying fund or qualifying company. (2) If (a) a participant in the relevant fund disposes of a unit in the relevant fund; (b) the participant is a company which is wholly owned by one or more investors to which this paragraph applies; and (c) the participant is not a collective investment vehicle;any gain accruing on the disposal is not a chargeable gain. (3) Nothing in paragraph 21 is to result in a deemed disposal of an asset held by any investor to which this paragraph applies other than an insurance company. (4) Each of the following is an investor to which this paragraph applies (a) any person who is a qualifying institutional investor within the meaning of Schedule 7AC (substantial shareholding exemption); (b) a company carrying on life assurance business where; immediately before the disposal; its right or interest in the participant is an asset which; applying the rules in section 138 of the Finance Act 2012; is wholly matched to a liability of its life assurance business that is not BLAGAB; (c) a company carrying on long-term business none of which is BLAGAB where; immediately before the disposal; its right or interest in the participant is an asset held for the purposes of its long-term business; and (d) a qualifying fund or qualifying company in respect of which an election under paragraph 12 has effect. (5) In this paragraph BLAGAB means basic life assurance and general annuity business.

(2) The ownership of the qualifying institutional investors in the investing company is to be ignored for the purpose of applying the exemption conferred by paragraph 3A of Schedule 7AC so far as the ownership is through Q. (3) In this paragraph qualifying institutional investors has the same meaning as in Schedule 7AC. (4) Paragraph 3B of Schedule 7AC (meaning of ownership) applies for the purposes of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes of paragraph 3A of that Schedule. Relationship between rules in this Part and REIT rules in Part 12 of CTA 201035 (1) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule is to exempt so much of any qualifying REIT gain as accrues on a disposal made by a company which is; or is a member of; a UK REIT. (2) A chargeable gain is a qualifying REIT gain so far as (a) the gain is not a chargeable gain as a result of section 535 or 535A of CTA 2010; and (b) the gain is not one falling to be exempted as a result of the application of either of those sections following a notice given under section 586 (1) or 587 (1) of that Act (venturing group). (3) In this paragraph UK REIT has the same meaning as in Part 12 of CTA 2010. 36 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) a gain accrues on a disposal made by a company (the JV company) which is a member of a group UK REIT; (b) the gain is one falling to be exempted as a result of the application of section 535 or 535A of CTA 2010 following a notice given under section 586 (1) or 587 (1) of that Act (venturing group); (c) the principal company of the group UK REIT that gave the notice is covered by an election made under paragraph 12 in respect of a qualifying fund; and (d) the JV company is also covered by the election. (2) The amount of the gain accruing to the JV company which is not a chargeable gain as a result of the operation; by reference to the election; of the rules in this Part of this Schedule (a) is found by first taking the two steps mentioned below (which require the application of each of the exemption rules without regard to the other); and (b) once those two steps are taken; is so much of the amount found by the first step as exceeds the amount found by the second step. (3) The first step is; ignoring the effect of Part 12 of CTA 2010; to apply the rules in this Part of this Schedule that operate by reference to the election to identify the amount of the gain which (but for this paragraph) would not be chargeable. (4) The second step is; ignoring the effect of this Part of this Schedule; to apply the rules in Part 12 of CTA 2010 that operate in relation to the group UK REIT to identify the amount of the gain accruing to the JV company which falls to be exempted as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b). (5) In the case of a disposal; a company is covered by an election made under paragraph 12 for the purposes of this paragraph if the disposal is one to which paragraph 16 applies where the election concerned is the one referred to in this paragraph. (6) In this paragraph group UK REIT has the same meaning as in Part 12 of CTA 2010. Separate application of exemptions under this Schedule and elsewhere37 (1) If (a) a person disposes of a right or interest in a company on which a gain or loss accrues; and (b) proportions of the gain or loss are not chargeable or allowable as a result of the operation of any relevant exemption provision;each relevant exemption provision is to work separately (without regard to the other) in relation to each proportion of the gain or loss to which the relevant exemption provision applies. (2) Accordingly (a) each relevant exemption provision is to operate by reference to the whole of the gain or loss (ignoring the effect of the other relevant exemption provision); and (b) the total proportion of the gain or loss which is not chargeable or allowable is the total of the proportions separately found (but not so as to exceed the whole amount of the gain or loss). (3) Each of the following is a relevant exemption provision for the purposes of this paragraph (a) any provision made by this Part of this Schedule; (b) any provision made by paragraph 3A of Schedule 7AC; and (c) any provision made by Part 12 of CTA 2010. (4) This paragraph is subject to paragraphs 34 to 36.

(3) The reference here to a modified version of the rule in paragraph 9 of Schedule 1A is to the rule in that paragraph as it has effect without regard to paragraph 10 and as if in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 9 the following modifications were made (a) for the opening words substitute A person or persons together (P) has or have a 100% investment in a company (C) if all of the following conditions are met; (b) omit paragraph (a); (c) in each of paragraphs (b); (c) and (d); for 25% or more substitute 100%; and (d) for the or at the end of paragraph (c) substitute and. 41 (1) For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule a collective investment scheme or person wholly (or almost wholly) owns a company at any time if (a) the scheme or person wholly owns the company at that time; or (b) the scheme or person has a 99% investment in the company at that time.

(5) The amendments made by this paragraph have effect where the ascertained consideration is received on or after 6 April 2019; but; subject to the following modifications; in a case where the original disposal was made before that date. (6) In that case; section 48A of TCGA 1992 (a) has effect without the amendments made by sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) (b); and (b) has effect as if; in step 3 in subsection (2) (c) of that section; for (of the type appropriate to the computation) (in both places) there were substituted (of a kind most closely corresponding to that accruing on the original disposal). 28In section 59 (partnerships); in subsections (2) (b); (3) and (4); for capital gains of the partnership substitute chargeable gains of the partnership. 29 (1) Section 62 (death: general provisions) is amended as follows.

(2) The appropriate proportion of a gain accruing to A on the disposal is not a chargeable gain. (3) The asset disposed of is regarded for the purposes of section 550 as used for the purposes of As property rental business to an extent equal to the appropriate proportion. (4) In the case of a non-UK member of a group UK REIT; this section has effect as if any reference to property rental business of the member were to its UK property rental business. (5) In relation to a disposal of a right or interest in B (a) B is UK property rich for the purposes of this section if the disposal would be regarded for the purposes of Schedule 1A to TCGA 1992 as a disposal of an asset deriving at least 75% of its value from UK land; and (b) any reference in this section to the appropriate proportion is to the proportion that; at the beginning of the accounting period in which the disposal is made; the value of Bs relevant PRB assets bears to the total value of Bs assets. (6) For the purposes of subsection (5) (b) (a) the value of Bs relevant PRB assets means the value of Bs assets deriving (directly or indirectly) from assets used for the purposes of UK property rental business; (b) Bs assets are to be valued in accordance with section 533 (1) (d); and (c) if the asset disposed of was acquired after the beginning of the accounting period; it is to be assumed that an accounting period began on the day on which the disposal is made. (7) Any reference in this section to the disposal of a right or interest in B includes the disposal of a right or interest in an offshore collective investment vehicle (a relevant fund) (a) to which paragraph 8 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 applies; but (b) in relation to which an election under that paragraph has not been made. (8) In the case of a disposal which is; as a result of subsection (7); a disposal of a right or interest in B; the value of Bs relevant PRB assets for the purposes of subsection (5) (b) is taken to be (a) the value of Bs assets that are used for the purposes of UK property rental business; plus (b) the value of Bs assets deriving indirectly from assets held by a relevant fund that are used for the purposes of UK property rental business. (9) This section is to be read as if it were contained in TCGA 1992. (10) Apart from subsection (7) of section 535; nothing else in that section applies in relation to a disposal to which this section applies. (11) This section does not apply to a gain (a) if sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 3A of Schedule 7AC to TCGA 1992 applies in relation to the gain (no chargeable gain accruing on disposals of certain shares by qualifying institutional investors); or (b) so far as sub-paragraph (4) of that paragraph applies to reduce the amount of the gain. 535BSection 535A: use of pre-April 2019 residual business losses or deficits (1) In determining the amount of a gain accruing to a company which is not to be a chargeable gain as a result of section 535A; any pre-April 2019 residual business losses or deficits which (a) have not been deducted from (or taken into account in calculating) other profits or gains (of any kind) of the company or any other person; and (b) have not previously been deducted under this subsection;may be deducted from the gain. (2) For this purpose pre-April 2019 residual business losses or deficits means (a) allowable losses accruing on disposals made before 6 April 2019; or (b) deficits or other losses for accounting periods ending before that date;which would otherwise have been deducted from (or taken into account in calculating) profits or gains (of any kind) accruing to residual business of the company. (3) If an accounting period (a straddling period) begins before and ends on or after 6 April 2019 (a) so much of the straddling period as falls before that date; and so much of it as falls on or after that date; are to be treated as separate accounting periods; and (b) if it is necessary to apportion an amount for the straddling period to the two separate accounting periods; it is to be apportioned (i) on a time basis according to the respective length of the separate accounting periods; or (ii) if that would produce a result that is unjust or unreasonable; on a just and reasonable basis. 116In section 547 (funds awaiting reinvestment); at the end insert (6) This section also applies to proceeds held in cash by a company on a disposal of an asset so far as section 535A secures that the appropriate proportion of a gain or loss accruing on the disposal is not a chargeable gain or allowable loss. 117In section 550 (3) (attribution of distributions); after section 535 insert or 535A. 118 (1) Section 556 (disposal of assets) is amended as follows. (2) After subsection (3) insert (3A) Subsection (3B) applies in the case of a company (C) which is; or is a member of; a UK REIT if (a) one or more properties acquired (directly or indirectly) by a relevant UK property rich company have been developed since acquisition; (b) the cost of the development exceeds 30% of the fair value of the property (determined in accordance with international accounting standards) at entry or at acquisition; whichever is later; (c) C disposes of any of its rights or interests in the relevant UK property rich company; (d) the disposal is made within the period of 3 years beginning with the completion of the development; and (e) if C is a member of a UK REIT; the disposal is not to another member of the UK REIT. (3B) If this subsection applies; section 535A is not to apply in relation to so much of the amount of a gain accruing on the disposal as relates to the property which has been developed. (3C) For the purposes of subsection (3A) (a) a company is a relevant UK property rich company if; as a result of section 535A; any part of a gain accruing to C on a disposal of a right or interest in the company would not be a chargeable gain; and (b) a relevant UK property rich company acquires property indirectly if property is acquired by someone other than the relevant UK property rich company and the property is taken into account in determining the value of the assets of the relevant UK property rich company. (3) In subsection (7); for Section 535 is substitute Sections 535 and 535A are. 119In section 582 (early exit); in subsection (3) (b); for or 535 (1) substitute; 535 (1) or 535A.

Section 14 SCHEDULE 2Returns for disposals of UK land etc PART 1Returns and payments on account: disposals of UK land etc Disposals to which Schedule applies1 (1) This Schedule applies for the purposes of capital gains tax to (a) any direct or indirect disposal of UK land which meets the non-residence condition (whether or not a gain accrues) and which is made on or after 6 April 2019; and (b) any other direct disposal of UK land on which a residential property gain accrues and which is made on or after 6 April 2020;but this Schedule does not apply to excluded disposals. (2) A disposal is an excluded disposal if (a) it is a disposal on which; as a result of any of the no gain/no loss provisions; neither a gain nor a loss accrues; (b) it is the grant of a lease for no premium to a person not connected with the grantor under a bargain made at arms length; (c) it is a disposal made by a charity; or (d) it is a disposal of any pension scheme investments. (3) The Treasury may by regulations amend sub-paragraph (2). (4) See also paragraph 9 for a case where a disposal which would have been within sub-paragraph (1) (b) if a gain had accrued is treated; for certain purposes; as if it were a disposal to which this Schedule applies. 2 (1) A disposal is a direct or indirect disposal of UK land which meets the non-residence condition if it is (a) a disposal on which a gain accrues that falls to be dealt with by section 1A (3) of TCGA 1992 because the asset disposed of is within paragraph (b) or (c) of that subsection; (b) a disposal on which a gain accrues that falls to be dealt with by section 1A (1) of that Act in accordance with section 1G (2) because the asset disposed of is within section 1A (3) (b) or (c); or (c) a disposal of an asset on which a gain does not accrue but which; had a gain accrued; would fall to be dealt with as mentioned in either of the preceding paragraphs of this sub-paragraph. (2) A disposal is any other direct disposal of UK land on which a residential property gain accrues if the disposal is a disposal on which a residential property gain accrues where (a) the land in question is in the United Kingdom; and (b) the gain falls to be dealt with by section 1A (1) or (3) (a) of TCGA 1992;and the disposal does not fall within sub-paragraph (1). (3) This paragraph applies for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule. Obligation to deliver a return to officer of Revenue and Customs3 (1) If a person makes a disposal to which this Schedule applies; the person (a) must make a return in respect of the disposal; and (b) must deliver the return to an officer of Revenue and Customs on or before the 30th day following the day of the completion of the disposal. (2) If (a) a person makes two or more disposals to which this Schedule applies; and (b) the disposals are made in the same tax year with the same completion date;the person must make and deliver a single return with respect to the disposals. (3) This paragraph is subject to (a) paragraph 4 (residential property gain accruing but no payment on account required); (b) paragraph 5 (ordinary tax return already delivered etc); and (c) paragraph 10 (disposal in case of a collective investment scheme). 4 (1) If (a) a person makes a disposal to which this Schedule applies as a result of paragraph 1 (1) (b); and (b) the person would not be liable under paragraph 6 to pay an amount on account of the persons liability to capital gains tax for the tax year concerned;the person is not required to make or deliver a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal. (2) In determining whether sub-paragraph (1) (b) applies; it is to be assumed that the person is required to make a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal. 5 (1) A person is not required to make or deliver a return under this Schedule in respect of a disposal if the filing date for the return would otherwise fall on or after (a) the date on which the person has delivered to an officer of Revenue and Customs the persons ordinary tax return containing a self-assessment that takes account of the disposal; or (b) the date on or before which the person has (by notice) been required to deliver to an officer of Revenue and Customs the persons ordinary tax return for the tax year concerned. (2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) (a); a self-assessment does not take account of the disposal if the amount of capital gains tax that is self-assessed is less than the amount that would be payable under paragraph 6 if the person were required to make and deliver a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal. Obligation to make a payment on account of capital gains tax6 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) a person is required to make a return under this Schedule in respect of any disposal; and (b) as at the filing date for the return; an amount of capital gains tax is notionally chargeable on the person (as determined in accordance with paragraph 7). (2) The person is liable to pay that amount on account of the persons liability to capital gains tax for the tax year concerned so far as that amount has not already become payable as a result of any previous return under this Schedule in respect of a disposal in that period. (3) The amount is payable on the filing date for the return. (4) For cases where there are repayments of amounts previously paid on account of capital gains tax; see paragraphs 8 and 9. Calculation of an amount of capital gains tax notionally chargeable7 (1) This paragraph applies for determining the amount of capital gains tax (if any) which is notionally chargeable on a person as at the filing date for a return. (2) The amount of capital gains tax notionally chargeable on the person as at that date is the amount of that tax for which the person would be liable for the tax year concerned; ignoring; for this purpose; the following disposals (a) disposals which have a completion date later than the completion date of the disposal in respect of which the return is made (but see sub-paragraph (3) ); and (b) disposals on which gains accrue but which are not disposals to which this Schedule applies. (3) A disposal on which a loss accrues is not to be ignored under sub-paragraph (2) (a) if the time at which the disposal is made (as determined under section 28 of TCGA 1992) falls on or before the completion date of the disposal in respect of which the return is made. (4) For provision relevant to the operation of this paragraph; see paragraphs 14 and 15 (making of assumptions; reasonable estimates etc). Repayments of amounts previously paid on account of capital gains tax8 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) a person makes and delivers a return under this Schedule in respect of a disposal; (b) the person has previously paid amounts on account of the persons liability to capital gains tax for the tax year concerned; and (c) the amounts exceed the amount of capital gains tax notionally chargeable on the person as at the filing date for the return. (2) The excess is repayable to the person on the filing date for the return. (3) In determining the total amount of payments that have; at any time; been made on account of a persons liability to capital gains tax for a tax year; account must be taken of amounts already repaid under this paragraph. 9 (1) If (a) a person makes a disposal on which an allowable loss accrues; and (b) had a gain accrued instead; the disposal would have been one to which this Schedule applies as a result of paragraph 1 (1) (b);the person may make and deliver a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal for the purpose of securing the application of paragraph 8. (2) Accordingly; the disposal is treated for that purpose as if it were a disposal to which this Schedule applies. (3) This paragraph does not apply in respect of a disposal if the filing date for the return which the person would otherwise be entitled to make and deliver falls on or after the date mentioned in paragraph 5 (1) (a) or (b). Collective investment schemes to which Sch. 5AAA to TCGA 1992 applies10 (1) A person is not required to make or deliver a return under this Schedule in respect of a disposal if (a) the disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment scheme for the purposes of paragraph 6 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992; and (b) the person would not be liable under paragraph 6 of this Schedule to pay an amount on account of the persons liability to capital gains tax for the tax year concerned. (2) In determining whether sub-paragraph (1) (b) applies; it is to be assumed that the person is required to make a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal. 11 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an election under paragraph 8 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 (election for CIS to be treated as partnership for purposes of Act) has effect in respect of an offshore collective investment scheme (within the meaning of that Schedule); (b) a disposal is made of property that is the subject of the scheme; (c) the disposal is made before the day on which this election is made; and (d) a person is required to make a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal. (2) The disposal is treated for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule as if it completed on the day on which the election is made. 12 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) a disposal is deemed to have been made by a person as a result of paragraph 21 or 22 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 (qualifying offshore CIS etc); and (b) the person is required to make a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal. (2) If the disposal is one to which paragraph 23 of that Schedule applies (gains treated as accruing when value received) (a) a disposal to which this Schedule applies is treated as being made by the person on each occasion on which any part of the gain is treated as accruing to the person under that paragraph; and (b) the time at which that disposal is treated as completing is the time at which the part of the gain is treated as so accruing to the person or; if later; the time at which the required notification is given to the person. (3) If the disposal is not one to which paragraph 23 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 applies; it is treated for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule as if it completed on the day on which the required notification is given to the person. (4) In this paragraph the required notification means notification under paragraph 25 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 in relation to the disposal deemed to have been made as a result of paragraph 21 or 22 of that Schedule. (5) In determining for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) (b) whether a person is required to make a return under this Schedule in respect of the disposal the effect of paragraphs 4; 5 and 10 is ignored. Effect of s. 144 (2) or 144A (2) (b) of TCGA 1992 when asset sold on exercise of option13 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an option is granted binding the grantor to sell an asset and the grant of the option is a disposal to which this Schedule applies; and (b) the option is then exercised so that; as a result of section 144 (2) or 144A (2) (b) of TCGA 1992; the grant of the option is treated as the same transaction as the sale. (2) Despite section 144 (2) or 144A (2) (b) of TCGA 1992; the grantor remains subject to the obligations under this Schedule in relation to the grant of the option. (3) In this paragraph references to sale are to be read in accordance with section 144 (6) of TCGA 1992. Making of assumptions; reasonable estimates etc14 (1) If; in determining whether a disposal is one to which this Schedule applies (a) a question arises as to whether a provision of TCGA 1992 applies; and (b) the determination of the question requires account to be taken of times after the completion of the disposal;it is to be assumed that the provision does apply if; at the time of the completion of the disposal; it is reasonable to expect that it will apply. (2) For the purposes of this Schedule it is to be assumed that a person has made a claim or election or given a notice if; at the time of the completion of the disposal in respect of which a return is required to be made under this Schedule; it is reasonable to expect that one will be made or given. (3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (2) is to be read as affecting (a) any requirement imposed by or under any Act for a claim; election or notice to be made or given in a particular way or by a particular time; or (b) any other provision made by or under any Act that is concerned with the making or giving of the claim; election or notice. (4) If (a) a person is required to make and deliver a return under this Schedule; and (b) having regard to the persons knowledge and all other relevant circumstances; it is reasonable to make an estimate of a qualifying matter;the person may make a reasonable estimate of that matter in the return. (5) For this purpose qualifying matter means (a) anything that is relevant to the application of section 1I of TCGA 1992; (b) the value of anything; or (c) the value of amounts to be apportioned to anything. 15 (1) This paragraph applies if a person is required to make and deliver a return under this Schedule in respect of a disposal and; at any time after the completion of the disposal (a) it becomes reasonable to expect that; by reference to the persons residence; a provision of TCGA 1992 will apply; (b) it becomes reasonable to conclude that a provision of TCGA 1992 conferring a relief applies in relation to the disposal; (c) matters relevant to the application of section 1I of TCGA 1992 become known; or it becomes reasonable to make a different estimate of those matters; where an estimate of those matters was used in the return; or (d) the value of anything; or of any amount to be apportioned to anything; becomes known where an estimate was used in the return. (2) The person may (but need not) assume; for the purposes of this Schedule (a) that there is an additional disposal to which this Schedule applies; (b) that the additional disposal completed at the later time by reference to which this paragraph applies; and (c) that the additional disposal is in all other respects a replication of the actual disposal. (3) In determining the amount of capital gains tax notionally chargeable as at the filing date for a return in respect of the additional disposal; the actual disposal is ignored. Contents of return16A return under this Schedule (a) must contain information of a description specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs (and different descriptions of information may be specified for different cases); and (b) must include a declaration by the person making it that the return is; to the best of the persons knowledge; correct and complete. Interpretation17 (1) In this Part of this Schedulethe filing date; in relation to a return in respect of a disposal; means the date on or before which the return in respect of the disposal must be delivered to an officer of Revenue and Customs;lease has the meaning given by paragraph 10 of Schedule 8 to TCGA 1992;ordinary tax return means a return under section 8 or 8A of TMA 1970;pension scheme investments means investments held for the purposes of a registered pension scheme or an overseas pension scheme (and expressions used in this definition have the same meaning as they have in section 271 (1A) of TCGA 1992);premium has the meaning given by paragraph 10 of Schedule 8 to TCGA 1992;residential property gain has the meaning given by Schedule 1B to TCGA 1992; andthe tax year concerned; in relation to a disposal; means the tax year in which the disposal is made.

Section 16 SCHEDULE 4Avoidance involving profit fragmentation arrangements Introduction and overview1 (1) This Schedule contains provision about countering the tax effects of certain arrangements (profit fragmentation arrangements). (2) Profit fragmentation arrangements involve the following parties (a) a person resident in the United Kingdom (the resident party); (b) an overseas person or entity (the overseas party) who is not resident in the United Kingdom; and (c) an individual (a related individual) who is (i) the resident party; (ii) a member of a partnership of which the resident party is a partner; or (iii) a participator in a company which is the resident party. (3) An overseas person or entity means (a) a person abroad within the meaning given by section 718 of ITA 2007; or (b) a company; partnership; trust or other entity or arrangements established or having effect under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom (regardless of whether it has legal personality as a body corporate). (4) Paragraphs 2 to 6 deal with the definition of profit fragmentation arrangements. (5) Paragraph 7 deals with the adjustments which must be made to counteract the effects of such arrangements. (6) Other provisions of this Schedule (a) deal with double taxation and the tax treatment of reimbursement payments (paragraphs 8 and 9); and (b) deal with interpretation and commencement (paragraphs 10 to 12). Profit fragmentation arrangements2 (1) Arrangements are profit fragmentation arrangements if (a) provision has been made or imposed as between the resident party and the overseas party by means of the arrangements (the material provision); (b) as a result of the material provision; value is transferred from the resident party to the overseas party which derives directly or indirectly from the profits of a business chargeable to income tax or corporation tax (see paragraph 3); (c) the value transferred is greater than it would have been if it had resulted from provision made or imposed as between independent parties acting at arms length; and (d) any of the enjoyment conditions are met in relation to a related individual (see paragraph 4). (2) But arrangements are not profit fragmentation arrangements if (a) the material provision does not result in a tax mismatch for a tax period of the resident party (see paragraphs 5 and 6); or (b) it is not reasonable to conclude that the main purpose; or one of the main purposes; for which the arrangements were entered into was to obtain a tax advantage. (3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) (a) provision made or imposed as between a partnership of which the resident party is a member and the overseas party is to be regarded as provision made or imposed as between the resident party and the overseas party. Transfer of value deriving directly or indirectly from a business3 (1) In determining whether value deriving directly or indirectly from a business is transferred from the resident party to the overseas party; account is to be taken of any method; however indirect; by which (a) any property or right is transferred or transmitted; or (b) the value of any property or right is enhanced or diminished. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) applies in particular to (a) sales; contracts and other transactions made otherwise than for full consideration or for more than full consideration; (b) any method by which any property or right; or the control of any property or right; is transferred or transmitted by assigning (i) share capital or other rights in a company; (ii) rights in a partnership; or (iii) an interest in settled property; (c) the creation of an option affecting the disposition of any property or right and the giving of consideration for granting it; (d) the creation of a requirement for consent affecting such a disposition and the giving of consideration for granting it; (e) the creation of an embargo affecting such a disposition and the giving of consideration for releasing it; and (f) the disposal of any property or right on the winding up; dissolution or termination of a company; partnership or trust. (3) Value may be traced through any number of individuals; companies; partnerships; trusts and other entities or arrangements. (4) The property held by a company; partnership; trust or other entity or under any arrangements must be attributed to the shareholders; partners or members; beneficiaries or other participants at each stage on a just and reasonable basis. The enjoyment conditions4 (1) The enjoyment conditions are met in relation to a related individual if (a) it is reasonable to conclude that some or all of the value transferred as a result of the material provision relates to something done by; or any property or purported right of; the individual; and (b) either of the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) is met. (2) The conditions are that (a) under the arrangements (i) the value transferred; or part of it; is so dealt with by any person as to be calculated at some time to enure for the benefit of the individual; (ii) the value transferred; or part of it; operates to increase the value of any assets which the individual holds or are held for the benefit of the individual; (iii) the individual receives or is entitled to receive any benefit provided or to be provided out of the value transferred or part of it; (iv) the individual may become entitled to the beneficial enjoyment of the value transferred; or part of it; if one or more powers are exercised or successively exercised (and for those purposes it does not matter who may exercise the powers or whether they are exercisable with or without the consent of another person); or (v) the individual (whether acting alone or together with any other person) is able in any manner to control directly or indirectly the application of the value transferred or part of it; or (b) it is reasonable to conclude that the individual (whether acting alone or with any other person) procured the transfer of value from the resident party to the overseas party in such a way as to avoid the conditions in paragraph (a) being met. (3) In determining whether the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) (a) are met in relation to an individual and the value transferred as a result of the material provision; all benefits which may at any time accrue to a person as a result of the value being transferred must be taken into account; irrespective of (a) the nature or form of the benefits; or (b) whether the person has legal or equitable rights in respect of the benefits. (4) For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (2) and (3); references to an individual include a reference to any person connected with that individual and; for the purposes of this paragraph; section 993 of ITA 2007 (meaning of connected) has effect but as if (a) subsection (4) of that section were omitted; and (b) members of a partnership in which the individual is also a member were not associates of the individual for the purposes of sections 450 and 451 of CTA 2010 (control). (5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4); an individual is treated as connected with a person or entity if (a) the individual or a person connected with the individual (whether acting alone or with any other person) (i) is able to secure that the person or entity acts in accordance with the wishes of the individual or any person connected with the individual; (ii) is able to acquire rights which would enable the individual or any person connected with the individual to secure that the person or entity acts in accordance with the wishes of the individual or any person connected with the individual; or (iii) is able to exercise significant influence over the person or entity (whether or not as a result of a legal entitlement of the individual or any person connected with the individual); or (b) the person or entity can reasonably be expected to act; or typically acts; in accordance with the wishes of the individual or a person connected with the individual. Tax mismatch5 (1) The material provision results in a tax mismatch for a tax period of the resident party if (a) in that period; in relation to a relevant tax; it results in one or both of (i) an increase in the expenses of the resident party for which a deduction is taken into account in calculating the amount of the relevant tax payable by the resident party; or (ii) a reduction in the income of the resident party which would otherwise have been taken into account in calculating the amount of the relevant tax payable by the resident party; (b) it is reasonable to conclude that (i) the resulting reduction in the amount of the relevant tax which is payable by the resident party exceeds the resulting increase in relevant taxes payable by the overseas party for the period corresponding to the tax period; and (ii) the overseas party does not meet the 80% payment test; and (c) the results described in paragraphs (a) and (b) (i) are not exempted by sub-paragraph (5). (2) In this Schedule references to the tax reduction are to the amount of the excess mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b) (i). (3) It does not matter whether the tax reduction results from the application of different rates of tax; the operation of a relief; the exclusion of any amount from a charge to tax; or otherwise. (4) The 80% payment test is met by the overseas party if the resulting increase in relevant taxes paid by that party as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b) (i) is at least 80% of the amount of the resulting reduction in the amount of the relevant tax payable by the resident party. (5) The results described in sub-paragraph (1) (a) and (b) (i) are exempted if they arise solely by reason of (a) contributions paid by an employer under a registered pension scheme; or overseas pension scheme; in respect of any individual; (b) a payment to a charity; (c) a payment to a person who; on the ground of sovereign immunity; cannot be liable for any relevant tax; or (d) a payment to an offshore fund or authorised investment fund (i) which meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition (whether or not a clearance has been given to that effect); or (ii) at least 75% of the investors in which are; throughout the accounting period; registered pension schemes; overseas pension schemes; charities or persons who cannot be liable for any relevant tax on the ground of sovereign immunity. (6) In this paragraph and paragraph 6; where the overseas party does not have an actual period for the purposes of relevant taxes which coincides with the tax period of the resident party (a) references to the corresponding period of the overseas party in relation to that tax period are to a notional period of that party for the purposes of relevant taxes that would coincide with that tax period; and (b) such apportionments as are just and reasonable are to be made to determine the income or tax liability of that party for that corresponding period. (7) In this paragraphrelevant tax means (a) income tax; (b) corporation tax on income; (c) a sum chargeable under section 269DA of CTA 2010 (surcharge on banking companies) as if it were an amount of corporation tax; (d) a sum chargeable under section 330 (1) of CTA 2010 (supplementary charge in respect of ring fence trades as if it were an amount of corporation tax); or (e) any non-UK tax on income; andtax period; in relation to a resident party; means (a) a tax year; or (b) if the resident party is a company; an accounting period of that party. Tax mismatch: resulting reduction and resulting increase6 (1) For the purposes of paragraph 5; the resulting reduction in the resident partys liability to a relevant tax for a tax period isATRwhereA is the sum of (a) if there are expenses within paragraph 5 (1) (a) (i); the lower of the amount of expenses and the amount of the deduction mentioned in that provision; and (b) any reduction in income mentioned in paragraph 5 (1) (a) (ii); andTR is the rate at which; assuming the resident party has profits equal to A chargeable to the relevant tax for the tax period; those profits would be chargeable to that tax. For this purpose; the rate at which those profits would be chargeable to that tax for that period is the highest rate at which that tax would be chargeable for that period if those profits were added to the resident partys total income. (2) For the purposes of paragraph 5 (1) (b) and (4); the resulting increase in relevant taxes payable by the overseas party for the period corresponding to the tax period is any increase in the total amount of relevant taxes that would fall to be paid by that party (and not refunded) assuming that (a) the overseas partys income for that period; in consequence of the material provision were an amount equal to A; (b) account were taken of any deduction or relief (other than any qualifying deduction or qualifying loss relief) taken into account by the overseas party in determining that partys actual liability to any relevant taxes in consequence of the material provision; and (c) all further reasonable steps were taken (i) under the law of any part of the United Kingdom or any country or territory outside the United Kingdom; and (ii) under double taxation arrangements made in relation to any country or territory;to minimise the amount of tax which would fall to be paid by the overseas party in the country or territory in question (other than steps to secure the benefit of any qualifying deduction or qualifying loss relief). (3) The steps mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) (c) include (a) claiming; or otherwise securing the benefit of; reliefs; deductions; reductions or allowances; and (b) making elections for tax purposes. (4) For the purposes of this paragraph; any withholding tax which falls to be paid on payments made to the overseas party is (unless it is refunded) to be treated as tax which falls to be paid by that party (and not the person making the payment). (5) For the purposes of this paragraph; an amount of tax payable by the overseas party is refunded if and to the extent that (a) any repayment of tax; or any payment in respect of a credit for tax; is made to any person; and (b) that repayment or payment is directly or indirectly in respect of the whole or part of the amount of tax payable by the overseas party;but an amount refunded is to be ignored if and to the extent that it results from qualifying loss relief obtained by that party. (6) Where some or all of the overseas partys income is treated for the purposes of a relevant tax charged under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom as the income of a person or persons other than the overseas party; in paragraph 5 and this paragraph (a) references to that partys liability to any tax (however expressed) include a reference to the liabilities of that person or those persons to the relevant tax; (b) references to any tax being payable by that party (however expressed) include a reference to the relevant tax being payable by that person or those persons; and (c) references to loss relief obtained by that party include a reference to loss relief obtained by that person or those persons;and sub-paragraph (4) applies to that person or any of those persons as it applies to that party. (7) In this paragraphqualifying deduction means a deduction which (a) is made in respect of actual expenditure of the overseas party; (b) does not arise directly from the arrangements; (c) is of a kind for which the resident party would have obtained a deduction in calculating that partys liability to any income tax or corporation tax had that party incurred the expenditure in respect of which the deduction is given; and (d) does not exceed the amount of the deduction that the resident party would have so obtained;qualifying loss relief means any means by which a loss might be used for tax purposes to reduce the amount in respect of which the overseas party is liable to tax on the profits of a business; andrelevant tax has the same meaning as in paragraph 5. Adjustments required to be made in relation to arrangements7 (1) Adjustments must be made so as to counteract the tax advantages that would (ignoring this Schedule) arise from profit fragmentation arrangements. (2) The adjustments (a) must relate to the expenses; income; profits or losses of the resident party for the tax period in which value is transferred as a result of the material provision; (b) must be based on what the value transferred would have been if it had resulted from a provision made or imposed as between independent parties acting at arms length; and (c) must be just and reasonable. (3) References in this paragraph to the resident party are references to the resident party at the time at which the material provision is made or imposed. Double taxation8 (1) This paragraph applies where (a) the resident party has paid a relevant tax by virtue of the application of paragraph 7; (b) at any time; the resident party or another person pays (i) a further amount of the relevant tax; or (ii) an amount of non-UK tax corresponding to the relevant tax; and (c) the result is a double payment of tax calculated by reference to the same income or profits. (2) In order to avoid the double payment of tax; the resident party may make a claim in writing for one or more consequential adjustments to be made in respect of the tax paid mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (a). (3) On a claim under this paragraph an officer of Revenue and Customs must make such of the consequential adjustments claimed (if any) as are just and reasonable. (4) The amount of any consequential adjustments must not exceed the lesser of (a) the tax paid by the resident party as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (a); and (b) the tax paid as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b). (5) Consequential adjustments may be made (a) in respect of any tax period; (b) by way of an assessment; the modification of an assessment; the amendment of a claim or otherwise; and (c) despite any time limit imposed by or under any enactment. Reimbursement payments ignored for tax purposes9In calculating income; profits or losses for any tax purposes; no account is to be taken of any amount which is paid (directly or indirectly) by a person for the purposes of meeting or reimbursing the cost of tax charged on the resident party by virtue of the application of paragraph 7. Treatment of a person who is a member of a partnership10 (1) This paragraph applies where a person is a member of a partnership. (2) Any references in this Schedule to the expenses; income; profits or losses of; or to the adjustment of the expenses; income; profits or losses of; the person includes a reference to the persons share of the expenses; income; profits or losses of; or adjustment of the expenses; income; profits or losses of; the partnership.

PART 3Commencement and transitional provisions Commencement35This Schedule comes into force on 6 April 2020 (the commencement date). Transitional provisions36Where a period of account of a company begins before and ends on or after the commencement date; it is to be assumed for the purposes of the amendments made by this Schedule (a) that the period (the straddling period of account) consists of two separate periods of account (i) the first beginning with the date on which the straddling period of account begins and ending with 5th April 2020; and (ii) the second beginning with the commencement date and ending with the date on which the straddling period of account ends; and (b) that separate accounts have been drawn up for each of those separate periods in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. 37 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) in a tax year ending before the commencement date a company makes a loss in a UK property business that is within the charge to income tax; (b) relief for the purposes of income tax is not given to the company for an amount of the loss (the unrelieved amount); and (c) on the commencement date the UK property business ceases to be within the charge to income tax and comes within the charge to corporation tax as a result of section 5 (3A) of CTA 2009. (2) Relief for the purposes of corporation tax is given to the company under this paragraph for the unrelieved amount. (3) For this purpose (a) the unrelieved amount is carried forward to post-commencement accounting periods of the company (for so long as the company continues to carry on the UK property business); and (b) the profits of any such accounting period that are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) are to be reduced by the unrelieved amount (so far as that amount cannot be used under this paragraph to reduce the profits of an earlier period). (4) The profits are (a) profits of the UK property business; and (b) profits arising from loan relationships or derivative contracts that the company is a party to for the purposes of that business. (5) In this paragraph post-commencement accounting period means an accounting period ending after the commencement date. 38 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) in the tax year 2019-20 a non-UK resident company is a partner in a firm which (i) carries on a trade; and (ii) has untaxed income or relievable losses from a UK property business; and (b) accordingly; the company is treated under section 854 of ITTOIA 2005 as having a notional business for the tax year. (2) The basis period for the notional business for the tax year is taken to end with 5th April in that tax year (if it would not otherwise do so). (3) In this paragraph untaxed income has the meaning given by section 854 (6) of ITTOIA 2005. 39 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) on or after the commencement date a loss arises in connection with a loan relationship of a company; (b) the loss is wholly or partly referable to a time before the commencement date (the pre-commencement time); and (c) had the loss arisen at the pre-commencement time it would have been brought into account in accordance with Part 3 of ITTOIA 2005 in calculating the profits of the UK property business of the company. (2) Section 327 (disallowance of imported losses etc) does not apply in relation to so much of the loss as is referable to the pre-commencement time. 40 (1) This paragraph applies for an accounting period (the loss period) of a non-UK resident company beginning on or after the commencement date if (a) apart from this paragraph; a loss arising in connection with a derivative contract of the company would by reason of this Schedule fall to be brought into account in accordance with Part 7 of CTA 2009; (b) the loss is wholly or partly referable to a time before the commencement date when the derivative contract was not subject to corporation tax; and (c) had the loss arisen at that time it would not have been brought into account in accordance with Part 3 of ITTOIA 2005 in calculating the profits of the UK property business of the company. (2) The amounts brought into account for the loss period in accordance with Part 7 of CTA 2009 must be such as to secure that none of the loss referable to that time is treated as arising in the loss period or any other accounting period of the company. (3) For the purposes of this section a loss is referable to a time when a contract is not subject to corporation tax so far as; at the time to which the loss is referable; the company would not have been chargeable to corporation tax on any profits arising from the contract. (4) If the company was not a party to the contract at the time to which the loss is referable; subparagraph (3) applies as if the reference to the company were a reference to the person who at that time was in the same position as respects the contract as is subsequently held by the company. (5) An amount which would be brought into account in accordance with Part 7 of CTA 2009 in respect of a derivative contract apart from this paragraph is treated for the purposes of section 699 (1) of CTA 2009 (amounts brought into account under Part 7 excluded from being otherwise brought into account) as if it were so brought into account. (6) Accordingly; that amount must not be brought into account for corporation tax purposes as respects the derivative contract either in accordance with Part 7 of CTA 2009 or otherwise. 41 (1) This paragraph applies for an accounting period (the relevant period) of a non-UK resident company beginning on or after the commencement date if (a) a profit arising in connection with a loan relationship or derivative contract of the company (the first instrument) falls by reason of this Schedule to be brought into account in the relevant period in accordance with Part 5 or Part 7 of CTA 2009; (b) an amount of the profit (the profit amount) is referable to a time before the commencement date when the first instrument was not subject to corporation tax; (c) had the profit arisen at that time it would not have been brought into account in accordance with Part 3 of ITTOIA 2005 in calculating the profits of the UK property business of the company; (d) at that time the first instrument and another loan relationship or derivative contract (the second instrument) were in a hedging relationship with one another; and (e) an amount of a loss (the loss amount) arising in connection with the second instrument would (apart from this paragraph) be prevented by reason of paragraph 40 or section 327 of CTA 2009 from being brought into account in the relevant period accordance with Part 5 or Part 7 of CTA 2009. (2) So much of the loss amount as does not exceed the profit amount may be brought into account in the relevant period in accordance with Part 5 or Part 7 of CTA 2009. (3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) the first instrument and the second instrument are in a hedging relationship with one another in so far as one of them is intended to act as a hedge of the companys exposure to changes in the fair value of the other. (4) In a case where the first instrument and the second instrument are in a hedging relationship with one another to a limited extent; subsection (2) has effect in relation to so much of the loss amount as is just and reasonable having regard to the extent of that hedging relationship. (5) For the purposes of this paragraph a profit is referable to a time when the first instrument is not subject to corporation tax so far as; at the time to which the profit is referable; the company would not have been chargeable to corporation tax on any profits arising from the instrument. (6) If the company was not a party to the first instrument at the time to which the profit is referable; subparagraph (5) applies as if the reference to the company were a reference to the person who at that time was in the same position as respects the instrument as is subsequently held by the company. 42 (1) Where (a) before the commencement date a company is chargeable to income tax on the profits of its UK property business; (b) on the commencement date the company becomes chargeable to corporation tax on the profits arising from a derivative contract that it is a party to for the purposes of its UK property business; and (c) there is a tax asymmetry in relation to the derivative contact;the amounts to be brought into account in respect of the derivative contract for the purposes of Part 7 of CTA 2009 are to be adjusted in such manner as is just and reasonable having regard to the tax asymmetry. (2) For the purposes of subparagraph (1) there is a tax asymmetry in relation to the derivative contract if (a) fair value amounts arising in relation to the derivative contract are brought into account in calculating for the purposes of income tax the profits or losses of the companys UK property business for tax years ending before the commencement date; but (b) by reason of regulation 9 of the Disregard Regulations; fair value amounts arising in relation to the contract are not brought into account for the purposes of Part 7 of CTA 2009 for accounting periods of the company beginning on or after the commencement date. (3) In this paragraphfair value amount means an amount representing a change in the fair value of a derivative contract which is recognised in determining a companys profit or loss for a period of account in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice;the Disregard Regulations means the Loan Relationships and Derivative Contracts (Disregard and Bringing into Account of Profits and Losses) Regulations 2004 (S. I. 2004/3256). 43 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) an amount representing a change in the fair value of a derivative contract is recognised in determining a companys profit or loss for a period of account beginning before the commencement date; and (b) the amount would have been brought into account in calculating for the purposes of income tax the profits or losses of the companys UK property business for a tax year ending before the commencement date but for its having been treated as an amount of a capital nature. (2) In determining the amounts the company is to bring into account for the purposes of Part 7 of CTA 2009 for an accounting period beginning on or after the commencement date (a) the derivative contract is to be treated as being one in relation to which an election has effect under regulation 6A of the Disregard Regulations; and (b) if regulation 7 or 8 of those Regulations applies in relation to the derivative contract; the amount referred to in subparagraph (1) is to be treated for the purposes of regulation 10 of those Regulations as being an amount that has previously been excluded from being brought into account for the purposes of Part 7 of CTA 2009 by regulation 7 or 8 (as the case may be). (3) In this paragraphthe Disregard Regulations means the Loan Relationships and Derivative Contracts (Disregard and Bringing into Account of Profits and Losses) Regulations 2004 (S. I. 2004/3256);recognised means recognised in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. 44 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) before 1 January 2015 a company measures a relevant derivative contract at fair value; (b) on the commencement date the company comes within the charge to corporation tax by reason of this Schedule; and (c) the first relevant period of the company begins on or after the commencement date. (2) The company is to be treated for the purposes of regulation 6A of the Disregard Regulations as if it was a new adopter. (3) In this paragraphthe Disregard Regulations means the Loan Relationships and Derivative Contracts (Disregard and Bringing into Account of Profits and Losses) Regulations 2004 (S. I. 2004/3256); andthe first relevant period and relevant derivative contract have the meaning given by regulation 6A (5) of the Disregard Regulations. 45 (1) This paragraph applies if on the commencement date (a) an asset held by a non-UK resident company for the purposes of its UK property business becomes a chargeable intangible asset in relation to the company by reason of the business coming within the charge to corporation tax; or (b) an asset held by a non-UK resident company for the purposes of enabling it to generate other UK property income becomes a chargeable intangible asset in relation to the company by reason of that income coming within the charge to corporation tax. (2) Part 8 of CTA 2009 applies as if (a) the company had acquired the asset immediately on the commencement date; and (b) had done so for its accounting value at that time. (3) In this paragraphaccounting value and chargeable intangible asset have the meaning they have in Part 8 of CTA 2009; andother UK property income has the meaning it has in Part 2 of CTA 2009. 46 (1) An election under section 792 of CTA 2009 (reallocation of degrouping charge within a group) may not be made if (a) subsection (3A) of section 793 applies to B; and (b) the relevant time is before 5 July 2016. (2) An election under section 792 of CTA 2009 may not be made if (a) subsection (3B) of section 793 applies to B; and (b) the relevant time is before the commencement date. (3) In this paragraph references to B and the relevant time must be read in accordance with section 792 of CTA 2009. 47 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) before the commencement date a company incurs expenditure for the purposes of a UK property business it is about to carry on; (b) the company begins to carry on the business on or after the commencement date; and (c) when the company begins to carry on the business it is non-UK resident. (2) Subsection (7) of section 1147 of CTA 2009 (which enables a company to obtain relief for expenditure on contaminated or derelict land incurred prior to carrying on a UK property business) does not apply in relation to the expenditure. 48Where on the commencement date (a) a non-UK resident company ceases to be within the charge to income tax and comes within the charge to corporation tax by reason of this Schedule; and (b) an accounting period of the company begins in accordance with section 9 (1) (a) of CTA 2009;the Corporation Tax (Instalment Payments) Regulations 1998 (S. I. 1998/3175) do not have effect in relation to that accounting period. 49 (1) This paragraph applies if on or after 29 October 2018 a company enters into an arrangement the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which is to secure for any person a tax advantage related to the coming into force of this Schedule. (2) The tax advantage is to be counteracted by means of adjustments. (3) The adjustments may be made (whether by an officer of Revenue and Customs or the person who would obtain the tax advantage) by way of an assessment; the modification of an assessment; an amendment or disallowance of a claim; or otherwise. (4) In this paragrapharrangement includes any agreement; understanding; scheme; transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable);tax advantage has the meaning given by section 1139 of CTA 2010. 50 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) a company enters into an arrangement of a kind mentioned in paragraph 49 (1); (b) the arrangements are effected by taking only ordinary commercial steps in accordance with a generally prevailing commercial practice; (c) the tax advantage that the arrangements secure is the benefit of a relief expressly conferred by Part 10 of TIOPA 2010 (corporate interest restriction); and (d) securing that tax advantage is wholly consistent with the policy objectives of that Part.

(6) Section 879E (4) to (7) applies for the purposes of section 879F and this section. (7) Expressions used in this section have the same meaning as in section 879F. 879HPre-FA 2019 relevant asset: the fourth case (1) For the purposes of this Chapter a relevant asset of a company is a pre-FA 2019 relevant asset if (a) the company acquired the asset on or after 1 April 2019 directly or indirectly in consequence of; or otherwise in connection with; a disposal of a relevant asset by another person; and (b) the asset disposed of would have been a pre-FA 2019 relevant asset in the hands of the company had the person transferred it to the company at the time of the disposal.

(2) An obligation is unconditional if it may not be varied or extinguished by the exercise of a right (whether under contract or otherwise). 7 (1) The amendments made by this Schedule have effect in relation to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

Commencement10The amendments made by this Part of this Schedule have effect in relation to leases entered into on or after 1 January 2019. PART 3Changes to accounting standards and tax adjustments Repeal of section 53 of FA 201111 (1) In FA 2011; omit section 53 (leases and changes to accounting standards). (2) The amendment made by this paragraph has effect in relation to periods of account beginning on or after 1 January 2019. (3) But; for the purposes of Chapter 7 of Part 10 of TIOPA 2010 (corporate interest restriction: group-interest and group-EBITDA); the amendment made by this paragraph has effect in relation to periods of account of a worldwide group (within the meaning given by section 480 of that Act) beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Transitional provisions following repeal of section 53 of FA 2011: introductory12 (1) This paragraph and paragraphs 13 to 17 modify the effect of the change of basis provisions in relation to periods of account of a lessee beginning on or after 1 January 2019 if the lease is one (a) in respect of which; under generally accepted accounting practice; a right-of-use asset falls (or would fall) to be recognised for accounting purposes in the accounts of the lessee for any period of account (whether beginning before or on or after that date); and (b) which would not fall to be treated in those accounts as a finance lease if the lessee were required under generally accepted accounting practice to determine whether the lease would fall to be treated in those accounts as a finance lease. (2) In this Part of this Schedule; the change of basis provisions means (a) Chapter 17 of Part 2 and Chapter 7 of Part 3 of ITTOIA 2005 (adjustment income); and (b) Chapter 14 of Part 3 and sections 261 and 262 of CTA 2009 (adjustment on change of basis). Cases where asset first recognised for period of account beginning on or after 1 January 201913 (1) This paragraph applies if the right-of-use asset falls (or would fall) to be first recognised for accounting purposes in the accounts of the lessee for the first period of account beginning on or after 1 January 2019 (the first period of account). (2) Any adjustment income or adjustment expense; or any receipt or expense; treated by any of the change of basis provisions as arising in consequence of a change of accounting policy that results in the right-of-use asset being first recognised for accounting purposes is to be treated as arising over a period (the spreading period) determined in accordance with the following stepsStep 1Find for each lease the amount by which the credits exceed the debits (or vice-versa). For this purpose; the credits and the debits are the amounts which; under generally accepted accounting practice (a) are taken to equity as adjustments in the accounts of the lessee for the first period of account; and (b) are in consequence of the change of accounting policy that results in the right-of-use asset being first recognised for accounting purposes in those accounts. Step 2Calculate for each lease the percentage (the relevant percentage) that (a) the amount found under Step 1 for the lease bears to (b) the total of all amounts found under Step 1 (treating such amounts as positive amounts). Step 3Find for each lease the period which results from applying the relevant percentage to the term of the lease that remains unexpired as at the date on which the first period of account begins. For this purpose; the term of a lease is to be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice as it applies for the first period of account. Step 4Calculate the sum of all periods found under Step 3. Step 5The spreading period is the period equal to the sum calculated under Step 4 beginning with the day on which the first period of account begins. (3) An amount to be treated as arising in any period falling wholly or partly in the spreading period is to be determined in proportion to the number of days of the period falling within the spreading period. (4) This paragraph is subject to paragraphs 15 and 16 (transfers of leases and cessation of activities). Cases where asset first recognised for an earlier period of account14 (1) This paragraph applies if the right-of-use asset falls (or would fall) to be first recognised for accounting purposes in the accounts of the lessee for a period of account earlier than the first period of account. (2) The change of basis provisions and this Part of this Schedule have effect (a) as if there were a change of accounting policy with respect to the accounts of the lessee for the first period of account; and (b) as if the right-of-use asset falls (or would fall) to be first recognised for accounting purposes in those accounts. (3) In this paragraph the first period of account has the same meaning as in paragraph 13. Certain cases where there is a transfer of a lease15 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) before the whole of an amount has been treated by paragraph 13 as arising to the lessee; there is a transfer of a lease or part of a lease from the lessee to another person; (b) the transferee is connected to the lessee; (c) immediately after the transfer; the transferee carries on activities the profits of which are chargeable to income tax or corporation tax; and (d) the transfer is not one where it is reasonable to suppose that the transfer is; or arrangements of which the transfer is part are; designed to avoid tax. (2) The amount is to continue to be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 13 but is to be treated as arising to the transferee over so much of the spreading period as falls on or after the date on which the transfer takes place. (3) If; following the transfer; it is necessary to apportion between more than one person an amount treated by paragraph 13 or this paragraph as arising; the apportionment is to be made on a just and reasonable basis. (4) In this paragraphconnected is to be read in accordance with sections 993 and 994 of ITA 2007 and sections 1122 and 1123 of CTA 2010; andthe spreading period has the same meaning as in paragraph 13. Cases where lessee permanently ceases to carry on activities16 (1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies if (a) before the whole of an amount has been treated by paragraph 13 as arising; the lessee permanently ceases to carry on activities the profits of which are chargeable to income tax or corporation tax; and (b) the whole of the amount so far as not treated by paragraph 13 as arising is not treated by paragraph 15 (2) as arising to a transferee. (2) The amount so far as not otherwise treated as arising (a) is to be treated as arising to the lessee; and (b) is to be brought into account in calculating the profits of the lessee;immediately before the cessation. Application of paragraphs 12 to 16 to lease portfolios17 (1) This paragraph applies if a lessee; in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice; prepares accounts by reference to a portfolio of leases having similar characteristics rather than by reference to the individual leases. (2) Paragraphs 12 to 14 and 16 apply to the portfolio (subject to any necessary modifications) in the same way as they apply to a lease. (3) If there is a transfer of the portfolio (or an individual lease within the portfolio); paragraph 15 applies to the transfer (subject to any necessary modifications) in the same way as it applies to the transfer of a lease. Corporate interest restriction: changes of accounting policy18 (1) In section 426 of TIOPA 2010 (changes of accounting policy); in subsection (3); after paragraph (e) insert (f) paragraphs 12 to 17 of Schedule 14 to FA 2019 (transitional provision following the repeal of section 53 of FA 2011) so far as they have effect in relation to adjustments under Chapter 14 of Part 3 of CTA 2009 or sections 261 and 262 of that Act. (2) The amendment made by this paragraph has effect in relation to periods of account of a worldwide group (within the meaning given by section 480 of TIOPA 2010) beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Corporate interest restriction: treatment of certain adjustments19 (1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies if (a) an amount is brought into account for corporation tax purposes for a period of account beginning on or after 1 January 2019 as a receipt or expense treated by any of the change of accounting policy provisions as arising to a company which is a lessee; (b) the receipt or expense is treated as arising to the company in consequence of a change of accounting policy relating to a lease in respect of which the company is the lessee; (c) under the old accounting policy; the lease fell to be treated as a finance lease in the accounts of the company; and (d) under the new accounting policy; the lease would fall to be treated as a right-of-use lease in those accounts but for (i) the short term of the lease; or (ii) the low value of the leased asset. (2) For the purposes of Part 10 of TIOPA 2010 (corporate interest restriction) (a) if the amount is brought into account as an expense; tax-interest expense amount (see section 382 of that Act) does not include that amount; (b) if the amount is brought into account as a receipt; tax-interest income amount (see section 385 of that Act) does not include that amount. (3) This paragraph has effect in relation to adjustments to which the financial statements of a worldwide group are treated by section 426 of TIOPA 2010 (changes in accounting policy) as subject in the same way as it has effect in relation to adjustments made under the change of accounting policy provisions by a company and accordingly (a) if the amount is brought into account as an expense; relevant expense amount (see section 411 (1) of that Act) does not include that amount; (b) if the amount is brought into account as a receipt; relevant income amount (see section 411 (2) of that Act) does not include that amount. (4) In this paragraphthe change of accounting policy provisions means Chapter 14 of Part 3 and sections 261 and 262 of CTA 2009 (adjustment on change of basis); andright-of-use lease has the meaning given by section 494 of TIOPA 2010 (other interpretation). Section 37 SCHEDULE 15Oil activities: transferable tax history PART 1Election to transfer tax history Entitlement to make a TTH election1This Schedule applies if; on or after 1 November 2018; the OGA gives consent for a company (the seller) to sell an interest in a UK oil licence to another company (the purchaser). 2 (1) On or after the licence transfer date; the seller and purchaser may jointly make a TTH election in respect of an interest (the TTH asset) in a transferred oil field (the TTH oil field). (2) A TTH election is an election for (a) an amount of the sellers ring fence profits (the total TTH amount) to be treated; in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule; as if it were an amount of the purchasers profits (instead of the sellers profits); and (b) a corresponding amount of the sellers adjusted ring fence profits to be so treated for the purpose of Chapter 6 of Part 8 of CTA 2010 (supplementary charge). PART 2The total TTH amount The total TTH amount3 (1) The total TTH amount may comprise (a) an amount representing the sellers eligible ring fence profits for the reference accounting period; and (b) amounts representing the sellers eligible ring fence profits for so many of the preceding accounting periods ending on or after 17 April 2002 as the seller and purchaser may determine. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) is subject to (a) paragraph 4 (limits on total TTH amount); (b) paragraph 11 (consecutive accounting periods); and (c) paragraph 12 (the transferred profits amount for an accounting period). (3) See (a) paragraph 13 for the meaning of eligible ring fence profits; and (b) paragraph 102 for the meaning of reference accounting period in relation to the seller. Limits on total TTH amount4The total TTH amount must not exceed the lower of (a) the uplifted decommissioning costs estimate in relation to the TTH asset; and (b) the total amount of the sellers eligible ring fence profits for the period (i) beginning with 17 April 2002; and (ii) ending at the end of the reference accounting period. The uplifted decommissioning costs estimate5To determine the uplifted decommissioning costs estimate in relation to the TTH asset (a) determine the transferred proportion of the net cost amount (see paragraphs 6 and 7); (b) allocate the relevant proportion of the amount determined under paragraph (a) to the TTH asset (see paragraph 8); (c) adjust the allocated amount in accordance with paragraph 9; and (d) double the adjusted amount. 6 (1) The net cost amount is the appropriate DSA estimate of the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field. (2) A DSA estimate is an estimate approved for the purposes of a qualifying decommissioning security agreement. (3) If there is only one qualifying decommissioning security agreement relating to the TTH oil field; the appropriate DSA estimate is the most recent DSA estimate approved for the purposes of that agreement within the relevant period. (4) If there is more than one qualifying decommissioning security agreement relating to the TTH oil field; the appropriate DSA estimate is the lowest of the DSA estimates approved for the purposes of any of those agreements within the relevant period. (5) For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3) and (4); the relevant period is the period of 12 months ending with (a) the date on which the TTH election is made; or (b) in a case where the hive down condition (see paragraph 56 (5) ) is met; the date on which the seller and the purchaser cease to be associated with one another. 7The transferred proportion of the net cost amount is the proportion of the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field that; under the qualifying decommissioning security agreement for the purposes of which the appropriate DSA estimate is approved; is allocated to (a) the seller; in the case of an agreement entered into before the sale of the interest in the UK oil licence concerned; or (b) the purchaser; in the case of an agreement entered into on or after that date. 8In paragraph 5 (b); the relevant proportion means (a) the proportion that the interest in the TTH oil field which is the TTH asset bears to (i) the sellers other interests in the TTH oil field; if paragraph 7 (a) applies; or (ii) the purchasers other interests in the TTH oil field; if paragraph 7 (b) applies; or (b) if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined in accordance with paragraph (a); such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis. 9 (1) To adjust the allocated amount for the purposes of paragraph 5 (c) (a) disregard the adjustments listed in sub-paragraph (2) made; for the purposes of calculating the net cost amount; in accordance with the terms of the decommissioning security agreement; and (b) if; in making that calculation in accordance with those terms; the relevant proportion of the estimate of the decommissioning costs is increased by an amount to take account of inflation; disregard the amount (if any) by which the increase exceeds the standard inflation adjustment amount. (2) The adjustments to be disregarded are (a) any discount applied by reference to the period of time expected to elapse before the decommissioning costs are payable in relation to the TTH oil field; and (b) any adjustment made for the purposes of taking account of the risk that the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field will exceed the estimate of those costs. (3) The standard inflation adjustment amount means the amount (if any) by which the relevant proportion of the estimate of the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field would be increased if an adjustment for the purposes of taking account of inflation were made on the basis specified by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs for the purposes of this paragraph. 10 (1) A decommissioning security agreement is an agreement entered into for the purpose of (a) determining the costs of decommissioning an oil field; and (b) providing security for (i) the performance of obligations under an abandonment programme for the purposes of section 38A of the Petroleum Act 1998 (whether or not such a programme has been approved at the time the agreement is entered into); or (ii) the costs of decommissioning plant or machinery which is; or forms part of; a relevant onshore installation. (2) A decommissioning security agreement is qualifying for the purposes of this Schedule if (a) the seller is a party to the agreement; (b) at least one of the parties is not associated with the seller; and (c) the estimate approved for the purposes of the agreement is a reasonable estimate of the decommissioning costs for the oil field. (3) In a case where the corporate restructuring condition (see paragraph 56 (2) ) is met; sub-paragraph (2) (a) has effect as if the reference to the seller were a reference to a party to the third party election (as defined in that paragraph). (4) In sub-paragraph (1) abandonment programme has the meaning given by section 29 of the Petroleum Act 1998; andrelevant onshore installation has the same meaning as in section 163 of CAA 2001 (see subsection (3C) of that section). (5) See paragraph 98 of this Schedule and section 271 of CTA 2010 for further provision about the meaning of associated companies. Consecutive accounting periods11 (1) The total TTH amount may not include an amount representing the eligible ring fence profits for a particular accounting period (other than the reference accounting period) unless it also includes an amount representing the eligible ring fence profits for the next following qualifying accounting period. (2) An accounting period is qualifying for the purposes of this Schedule if the seller has eligible ring fence profits for that period. The transferred profits amount12 (1) The transferred profits amount for an accounting period; other than the earliest period; must be an amount equal to the amount of the sellers eligible ring fence profits for the period. (2) The transferred profits amount for the earliest period must be an amount equal to the amount of the sellers eligible ring fence profits for that period; so far as that amount does not exceed the TTH balance for the earliest period. (3) The TTH balance for the earliest period is an amount equal to (a) the total TTH amount; less (b) the transferred profits amounts for each later accounting period. (4) In this paragraph; earliest period means the earliest accounting period for which there is a transferred profits amount. Eligible ring fence profits13Ring fence profits of an accounting period are eligible for the purposes of a TTH election if; as at the date the TTH election is made (a) corporation tax is charged on the profits of that period at the main ring fence profits rate; (b) neither section 279B nor section 279C of CTA 2010 (marginal relief) applies in relation to the seller in that period; (c) the sellers liability to corporation tax in respect of the profits has been discharged in full; and (d) the total TTH amount for any other TTH election made by the seller (whether made with the purchaser or with another person) does not include an amount representing those profits. 14In determining; for the purposes of this Schedule; the amount of the sellers eligible ring fence profits for an accounting period that falls partly before 17 April 2002; the amount of the sellers eligible ring fence profits for that period is to be reduced by the proportion which the part of the accounting period falling before that date bears to the whole of the accounting period. PART 3Effect of a TTH election on the seller Application of this Part15This Part applies if (a) the seller and the purchaser have jointly made a TTH election in respect of the TTH asset; and (b) the TTH election has been approved by an officer of Revenue and Customs (see paragraphs 61 and 62). Effect of a TTH election: corporation tax16 (1) Sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) apply if the seller makes a loss in a trade in an accounting period. (2) For the purposes of section 37 (3) (b) of CTA 2010 (including for the purposes of that provision as it has effect under the other trade loss relief provisions); the sellers total profits of a pre-transfer accounting period are treated as being (a) the sellers total profits for that period; less (b) the transferred profits amount for that period. (3) For the purposes of section 42 of CTA 2010; the sellers profits of a ring fence trade of a pre-transfer accounting period are treated as being (a) the sellers ring fence profits for that period; less (b) the transferred profits amount for that period. 17The transferred profits amount for an accounting period is to be disregarded for the purposes of the application of any provision of the Corporation Tax Acts by reference to which the seller would (apart from this paragraph) be entitled to relief from; or a repayment of; corporation tax. 18 (1) Paragraphs 16 and 17 are subject to this paragraph. (2) If; on or after the licence transfer date; the sellers eligible ring fence profits for a pre-transfer accounting period are reduced to an amount which is lower than the transferred profits amount for that period (a) the seller is treated as incurring a loss in a ring fence trade; of an amount equal to the difference; for the accounting period; and (b) paragraph 17 does not apply to the difference. Effect of a TTH election: supplementary charge19Paragraphs 20 and 21 apply in relation to an accounting period for which there is a transferred profits amount. 20 (1) The transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the accounting period is to be disregarded for the purposes of any provision of the Corporation Tax Acts by reference to which the seller would (apart from this paragraph) be entitled to a repayment of supplementary charge. (2) The transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount is (a) in the case of an accounting period other than the earliest period; the amount of the sellers eligible adjusted ring fence profits for the period; (b) in the case of the earliest period; an amount equal to the transferred proportion of the sellers eligible adjusted ring fence profits for the period. 21 (1) For the purposes of the application of any provision of Part 4 or Part 8 of CTA 2010 in relation to the seller (a) the amount of each ARFP component; or (in the case of the earliest period) an amount equal to the transferred proportion of each ARFP component; for the accounting period is to be disregarded; and (b) in the case of the earliest period; references in those provisions to an ARFP component for the accounting period are to be treated as references to the retained proportion of that ARFP component for the period. (2) ARFP component; in relation to an accounting period; means (a) the financing costs for the period that are left out of account for the purposes of the assumption mentioned in section 330 (3) of CTA 2010; and (b) the amount of any reduction of the sellers adjusted ring fence profits by reference to the cumulative total amount of activated allowance for the period under any of the following provisions of CTA 2010 (i) section 332E (investment allowance); (ii) section 356D (onshore allowance); and (iii) section 356JG (cluster area allowance). (3) See paragraph 17 for provision about disregarding the transferred profits amount for an accounting period. (4) Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply in relation to the application of any provision for the purposes of determining the sellers eligible adjusted ring fence profits for an accounting period for the purposes of this Schedule. 22 (1) For the purposes of paragraphs 20 (2) and 21 (1) (a) earliest period has the meaning given by paragraph 12 (4); (b) the transferred proportion is the same as the proportion that the transferred profits amount for the accounting period bears to the sellers ring fence profits amount for the period; and (c) the retained proportion is the same as the proportion that the retained profits amount for the accounting period bears to the sellers ring fence profits amount for the period. (2) In sub-paragraph (1) (c); retained profits amount means the amount of the difference between the amount of the sellers ring fence profits for the earliest period and the transferred profits amount for that period. (3) For the purposes of this Schedule; adjusted ring fence profits of an accounting period are eligible if (a) an amount is charged on the profits under section 330 (1) of CTA 2010 (supplementary charge in respect of ring fence trades); and (b) as at the TTH election is made; the sellers liability to tax under that section in respect of the adjusted ring fence profits has been discharged in full. PART 4Effect of a TTH election on the purchaser Application of this Part23This Part applies if (a) the seller and the purchaser have jointly made a TTH election in respect of the TTH asset; (b) the TTH election has been approved by an officer of Revenue and Customs (see paragraphs 61 and 62); (c) the winning of oil from the TTH oil field has permanently ceased; and (d) in a post-acquisition accounting period (the loss period) (i) the purchaser makes a loss in a ring fence trade; (ii) the loss is a decommissioning loss; and (iii) the purchaser holds; for the loss period; an activated TTH amount (see Parts 5 and 6). 24In paragraph 23 (d) (ii); decommissioning loss means a loss in respect of which (a) a claim for relief under section 37 of CTA 2010 is made by the purchaser by virtue of section 39 or 40 of that Act (relief for trade losses: terminal losses and ring fence trades); or (b) relief is given under section 42 of CTA 2010 (ring fence trades: further extension of period for relief). Effect of trade loss relief provisions25 (1) The total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for the loss period is to be applied in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) (b) or (3) (b). (2) The purchasers total profits of a pre-acquisition accounting period are to be treated; for the purposes of section 37 (3) (b) of CTA 2010 (including for the purposes of that provision as it has effect under the other trade loss relief provisions) as being the total of (a) the amount of the purchasers total profits for that period; and (b) if and so far as the loss in respect of which relief is claimed exceeds the amount mentioned in paragraph (a); the activated transferred profits amount for that period. (3) The purchasers profits of a ring fence trade of a pre-acquisition accounting period are to be treated for the purposes of section 42 of CTA 2010; as being the total of (a) the purchasers profits of a ring fence trade for that period; and (b) if and so far as the loss in respect of which relief is claimed exceeds the amount mentioned in paragraph (a); the activated transferred profits amount for that period. (4) The activated transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period means the amount allocated to the period under paragraph 44 for the purposes of the application of this paragraph in relation to the loss period. (5) See paragraphs 38 to 42 for provision about the total activated TTH amount. Repayment of supplementary charge26 (1) This paragraph applies where; in respect of a loss period; an activated transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period is to be applied in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b). (2) A repayment of tax to be determined as if (a) an amount had been charged under section 330 (1) of CTA 2010 in respect of the activated ARFP amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period; (b) that amount had been charged on; and paid by; the purchaser (instead of the seller); and (c) the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period were recalculated in accordance with paragraph 50. (3) See paragraph 53 for provision about the activated ARFP amount. 27 (1) In this Schedule; references to the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser are references to (a) the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount (see paragraph 20 (2) ) for the accounting period of the seller which coincides with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser; or (b) if there is no coinciding accounting period of the seller; the overlapping proportion of the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for each accounting period of the seller that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser. (2) The overlapping proportion; in relation to an accounting period of the seller; is the same as the proportion that the part of the sellers accounting period that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser bears to the whole of the sellers accounting period. Supplementary provision: repayment and enquiries28For the purposes of section 59D (2) of TMA 1970 (repayment of excess corporation tax); the following amounts paid by the seller are treated as having been paid by the purchaser (a) the amount of corporation tax in respect of an activated transferred profits amount; for a pre-acquisition accounting period; that is applied in accordance with 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b); and (b) the amount of supplementary charge in respect of the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for that accounting period. 29 (1) An enquiry under Part 4 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 into a tax return for the accounting period in which the claim under section 37 of CTA 2010 in respect of a decommissioning loss in a loss period is made (see paragraphs 23 and 24); or an enquiry into the claim under Schedule 1A to TMA 1970; extends to (a) the decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field for any accounting period; (b) the tracked profit or loss amount attributable to the TTH asset for any accounting period; and (c) whether a TTH activation event has occurred in relation to the TTH asset. (2) See Part 5 for provision about the decommissioning expenditure amount and a TTH activation event; and paragraphs 64 and 65 for provision about the tracked profit and loss amount. PART 5TTH activation TTH activation event30 (1) A TTH activation event occurs in relation to the TTH asset if (a) the winning of oil from the TTH oil field has permanently ceased; and (b) at the end of a post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser; the total decommissioning expenditure amount exceeds the total net profits amount. (2) The total decommissioning expenditure amount is the relevant proportion of the total of the decommissioning expenditure amounts (see paragraph 31) attributable to the TTH oil field; in respect of which an allowance or allocation is made to the purchaser; for (a) the period mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b); and (b) each preceding accounting period which is a post-acquisition accounting period. (3) The total net profits amount is the aggregate of the tracked profit or loss amounts (see paragraphs 64 and 65) attributable to the TTH asset for (a) the period mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b); and (b) each preceding accounting period which is a post-acquisition accounting period. (4) But if the aggregate of the tracked profit or loss amounts attributable to the TTH asset for the periods mentioned in sub-paragraph (3) (a) and (b) is a negative amount; the total net profits amount is nil. (5) In this paragraph; the relevant proportion means the proportion that the interest in the TTH oil field which is the TTH asset bears to the purchasers other interests in the TTH oil field or; if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined on that basis; such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis. Decommissioning expenditure amount31The decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field for an accounting period; is the total of each of the following amounts attributable to the field for the post-acquisition accounting period (a) the special allowance amount; (b) the post-cessation expenditure amount; and (c) the restoration expenditure amount. 32 (1) The special allowance amount for an accounting period is the amount of a special allowance made under section 164 of CAA 2001 (general decommissioning expenditure incurred before cessation of ring fence trade) for that period. (2) A special allowance amount is attributable to the TTH oil field so far as the expenditure in respect of which the allowance is made is expenditure incurred on decommissioning plant or machinery brought into use for the purposes of oil-related activities carried on wholly or partly in direct connection with the field. 33 (1) The post-cessation expenditure amount for an accounting period is the amount that; under section 165 (3) (a) of CAA 2001 (general decommissioning expenditure after ceasing ring fence trade); is allocated to the appropriate pool for that period. (2) A post-cessation expenditure amount is attributable to the TTH oil field so far as the general decommissioning expenditure in respect of which the amount is allocated is expenditure incurred on decommissioning plant or machinery brought into use for the purposes of oil-related activities carried on wholly or partly in direct connection with the field. 34 (1) The restoration expenditure amount for an accounting period is the amount that is treated as qualifying expenditure under section 416ZA of CAA 2001 (ring fence trades: expenditure on site restoration) for that period. (2) A restoration expenditure amount is attributable to the TTH oil field if the qualifying expenditure is incurred in relation to the field. 35For the purposes of paragraphs 32 (2); 33 (2) and 34 (2); expenditure for an accounting period is to be apportioned between the TTH oil field and other oil fields (or parts of oil fields) on a just and reasonable basis. PART 6Allocation of activated TTH amount Application of this Part36This Part of this Schedule applies if a TTH activation event occurs in relation to the TTH asset. 37In this Schedule (a) first activation period means the first post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser in which a TTH activation event occurs; and (b) post-activation period means a subsequent accounting period of the purchaser. Total activated TTH amount38The total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for a loss period which is the first activation period is the lower of (a) the amount by which; at the end of that period; the total decommissioning expenditure amount exceeds the total net profits amount (see paragraph 30); and (b) the total TTH amount. 39The total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for a loss period which is a post-activation period is the lower of (a) the adjusted activated TTH amount (see paragraphs 40 to 42); and (b) the closing balance of the total TTH amount for the immediately preceding accounting period (see paragraph 49). 40 (1) This paragraph applies if; in relation to a post-activation period (a) the relevant proportion of the decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field for that period; exceeds (b) the tracked profit or loss amount attributable to the TTH asset for that period. (2) The additional activated TTH amount for the post-activation period is an amount equal to the excess. (3) For the purposes of paragraph 39; the adjusted activated TTH amount is the total of (a) the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period; and (b) the additional activated TTH amount for the post-activation period. (4) In this paragraph and in paragraph 41; relevant proportion has the same meaning as in paragraph 30 (5). 41 (1) This paragraph applies if; in relation to a post-activation period (a) the tracked profit or loss amount attributable to the TTH asset for that period; exceeds (b) the relevant proportion of the decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field for that period. (2) The TTH reduction amount for the post-activation period is an amount equal to the excess. (3) If the TTH reduction amount is less than the closing balance amount; the adjusted activated TTH amount for the purposes of paragraph 39 is an amount equal to the difference. (4) If the TTH reduction amount is equal to; or greater than; the closing balance amount; the adjusted activated TTH amount for the purposes of paragraph 39 is nil. (5) In this paragraph; references to the closing balance amount are references to the closing balance of activated TTH for the accounting period immediately preceding the post-activation period. 42If neither paragraph 40 nor paragraph 41 applies in relation to a post-activation period; the adjusted activated TTH amount for the purposes of paragraph 39 is (a) an amount equal to the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period; if it is greater than nil; or (b) nil; if the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period is nil or a negative amount. Allocation of activated TTH to an accounting period43Paragraph 44 applies for the purposes of paragraph 25 (effect of trade loss relief provisions in relation to the purchaser). 44The total activated TTH amount for a loss period is to be allocated; for the purposes of the application of paragraph 25 in relation to that loss period; to pre-acquisition accounting periods of the purchaser as followsStep 1Take the most recent pre-acquisition accounting period for which there is an unused transferred profits amount which is greater than nil. Step 2Allocate to that pre-acquisition accounting period an amount equal to the lower of (a) the unused transferred profits amount; and (b) the total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for the loss period. Step 3Allocate to the next most recent pre-acquisition accounting period an amount equal to the lower of (a) the transferred profits amount for that period; and (b) the available activated TTH amount for the loss period. Step 4Repeat Step 3 (taking later pre-acquisition accounting periods before earlier ones) until the amount given by paragraph (a) or (b) is nil. Transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period45 (1) In this Schedule; references to the transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser are references to (a) the transferred profits amount for the accounting period of the seller which coincides with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser; or (b) if there is no coinciding accounting period of the seller; the overlapping proportion of the transferred profits amount for each accounting period of the seller that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser. (2) The overlapping proportion; in relation to an accounting period of the seller; is the same as the proportion that the part of the sellers accounting period that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser bears to the whole of the sellers accounting period. Unused transferred profits amount46 (1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of Steps 1 and 2 of paragraph 44. (2) If the loss period is the first activation period; the reference to the unused transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period is a reference to the transferred profits amount for that period. (3) If the loss period is a post-activation period; the reference to the unused transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period is a reference to the amount equal to (a) the transferred profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period; less (b) the total of the amounts applied for the pre-acquisition accounting period in accordance with paragraph 25; for the purposes of the application of that paragraph in relation to the first activation period or an earlier post-activation period. Available activated TTH amount47 (1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of allocating an amount to a pre-acquisition accounting period under Step 3 of paragraph 44. (2) The available activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for the loss period; is an amount equal to (a) the total activated TTH amount for the period; less (b) the total of the activated transferred profits amounts allocated under paragraph 44 to later pre-acquisition accounting periods. (3) In sub-paragraph (2) (b) the reference to later pre-acquisition accounting periods is a reference to pre-acquisition accounting periods that begin after the period mentioned in sub-paragraph (1). Closing balance of activated TTH48 (1) The closing balance of activated TTH for the first activation period; or a post-activation period in relation to which paragraph 40; 41 (3) or 42 applies; the closing balance of activated TTH for the period is (a) the total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for that period; less (b) the amount applied in accordance with paragraph 25 for that period. (2) If paragraph 41 (4) applies in relation to a post-activation period; the closing balance of activated TTH for the period is the negative amount determined by deducting (a) the TTH reduction amount for that period; from (b) the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period. Closing balance of the total TTH amount49The closing balance of the total TTH amount for an accounting period is (a) the total TTH amount; less (b) the total of the amounts (if any) applied in accordance with paragraph 25 for that accounting period and earlier accounting periods. PART 7Supplementary charge: recalculation of adjusted ring fence profits Recalculation: steps50 (1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of recalculating the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period mentioned in paragraph 26 (1) (for the purposes of paragraph 26 (2) (c) ). (2) The recalculated transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the period is the aggregate of (a) the reduced ARFP amount for the pre-acquisition period (see paragraphs 51 and 52); and (b) the adjusted finance cost amount for the loss period mentioned in paragraph 26 (1) (see paragraph 55). (3) But if the amount given by taking the steps in sub-paragraph (2) is a negative amount; the recalculated transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount is nil. Reduced ARFP amount51 (1) To determine the reduced ARFP amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period (a) take the activated ARFP amount for the period; and (b) reduce that amount by the amount applied; in relation to the loss period mentioned in paragraph 26 (1); in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period. (2) This paragraph is subject to paragraph 52. 52 (1) This paragraph (instead of paragraph 51) applies if the percentage specified in section 330 (1) of CTA 2010 for the pre-acquisition accounting period mentioned in paragraph 26 (1) is greater than 20%. (2) To determine the reduced ARFP amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period (a) calculate the total of (i) the activated ARFP amount for the period; and (ii) the ARFP uplift amount for the period (see paragraph 54); (b) reduce the amount given by paragraph (a) by the amount applied; in relation to the loss period mentioned in paragraph 26 (1); in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period. Activated ARFP amount53 (1) The activated ARFP amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period is the amount equal towhereA is the amount applied; in relation to the loss period; in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period;T is the unused transferred profits amount for that period; and (2) In sub-paragraph (1); unused transferred profits amount has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of Steps 1 and 2 of paragraph 44 (see paragraph 46). (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies if; in respect of an earlier loss period (a) an activated transferred profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period mentioned in paragraph 26 (1) is applied in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b); and (b) a corresponding repayment is determined under paragraph 26 (2) (an earlier repayment). (4) The amount of the transferred adjusted ring fence profits for the pre-acquisition accounting period is treated; for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1); as being reduced by an amount equal to the total of the activated ARFP amounts for that period for the purposes of each earlier repayment. ARFP uplift amount54The ARFP uplift amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period is the amount equal towhereSC is the percentage specified in section 330 (1) of CTA 2010 for the pre-acquisition accounting period; andA is the amount applied; in relation to the loss period; in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period. Adjusted finance cost amount55The adjusted finance cost amount for a loss period is the amount equal towhereA is the amount applied; in relation to the loss period; in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period;L is the amount of the decommissioning loss in the loss period (see paragraph 23 (d) (i) and (ii) ); andFC is the lower of (a) the amount of the financing costs brought into account under section 330 (3) of CTA 2010 for the purposes of determining the purchasers adjusted ring fence profits for the loss period; and (b) the amount of the purchasers loss in the ring fence trade for the loss period (see paragraph 23 (d) (i) ).

(2) If notice is given under sub-paragraph (1); the TTH election ceases to have effect in relation to the purchaser for the accounting period in which the notice is given and each subsequent accounting period. (3) A notice given under sub-paragraph (1) does not affect any relief given by reference to paragraph 25 or 26 for a loss period ending before the notice is given. (4) See paragraph 94 for provision about appeals against a decision to withdraw an election under this paragraph. PART 11TTH elections: inaccuracies Penalties for errors73If a document provided for the purposes of making a TTH election contains an inaccuracy which is; or results in; an overstatement of the total TTH amount; Schedule 24 to FA 2007 has effect as if (a) the seller (and not the purchaser) is treated as giving the document to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs; (b) the inaccuracy is treated (so far as would not otherwise be the case) as leading to a false or inflated claim to repayment of tax; and (c) the potential lost revenue in respect of the inaccuracy is an amount equal to 10% of the amount by which the total TTH amount is overstated. Amendment of TTH election: amounts discovered to be incorrect74 (1) This paragraph applies if an officer of Revenue and Customs discovers that a TTH election incorrectly states an amount that affects; or may affect (a) the amount which may be applied in accordance with paragraph 25 (effect of trade loss relief provisions); or (b) the amount of a repayment determined by reference to paragraph 26 (supplementary charge: repayment of tax). (2) The officer (a) may amend the TTH election to correct that amount; subject to paragraph 75; and (b) must give notice to the purchaser of an amendment under paragraph (a). (3) But the power to amend the TTH election under this paragraph may only be exercised if; at the time the election was approved (see paragraphs 61 and 62); an officer of Revenue and Customs could not have been reasonably expected; on the basis of the information made available to the officer before that time; to be aware that the amount stated was incorrect. (4) An amendment under this paragraph may not be made more than 12 months after information that; in the opinion of an officer of Revenue and Customs; justifies the correction of the TTH election; comes to the officers attention. (5) An amendment under this paragraph is to be ignored for the purposes of the application of Part 3 of this Schedule (effect of a TTH election on the seller). (6) If; on or after the licence transfer date; the sellers total profits for a pre-transfer accounting period are reduced; the statement of the total profits (or a statement of an amount determined by reference to the total profits) is not to be regarded as incorrect for the purposes of this paragraph (but see paragraph 18). (7) See paragraph 94 for provision about appeals against a decision under this paragraph. 75 (1) This paragraph applies if; before the correction under paragraph 74 is made; an activated transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period has been applied in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) or (3) (b). (2) An amendment made under paragraph 74 (2) may not (a) reduce the transferred profits amount for that pre-acquisition accounting period to an amount which is less than the amount that has been applied; in respect of loss periods ending before the determination is made; in accordance with paragraph 25 for the pre-acquisition accounting period; or (b) reduce the total TTH amount to an amount which is less than the total of the amounts that have been applied in accordance with paragraph 25 in respect of loss periods ending before the determination is made. PART 12Chargeable gains Transferred tax history is not to be regarded as an asset76Where the seller and the purchaser jointly make a TTH election in respect of the TTH asset; the transfer of tax history is not to be treated as (a) the disposal or acquisition of an asset for the purposes of TCGA 1992; or (b) the disposal or acquisition of an intangible fixed asset for the purposes of Part 8 of CTA 2009. Consideration for transferred tax history to be treated as consideration for the licence interest77The amount or value of any consideration for the transfer of tax history is to be treated as part of the consideration for the licence interest for the purposes of (a) computing the chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing on the disposal (or on any subsequent disposal) of the licence interest (see section 8 of TCGA 1992); and (b) computing the disposal value of the licence interest; on its disposal; for the purposes of Part 5 of CAA 2001 (mineral extraction allowances). Market value of the licence interest: value of transferred tax history to be taken into account78Any value attributable to the transfer of tax history is to be taken into account in determining the market value of the licence interest for the purposes of (a) section 17 of TCGA 1992 (disposals and acquisitions treated as being made at market value); (b) Part 5 of CAA 2001; if the disposal value of the licence interest for the purposes of that Part is the market value of the licence interest at the time of that disposal (see section 423 of CAA 2001). Licence swaps: references to disposal include references to transfer of tax history79For the purposes of the application of sections 195A to 196 of TCGA 1992 (oil licence swaps) in relation to the disposal of the licence interest by the seller to the purchaser; references in those sections to the disposal are treated as including references to the transfer of tax history. Interpretation of this Part80 (1) References in this Part to the transfer of tax history are references to (a) the seller; in consequence of the TTH election; ceasing to be entitled to take the transferred profits for an accounting period into account for certain corporation tax purposes in the circumstances specified in Part 3 of this Schedule; and (b) the purchaser; in consequence of the TTH election; acquiring an entitlement; in the circumstances specified in Part 4 of this Schedule; to apply an amount of the transferred profits for the purposes of the trade loss relief provisions and to a corresponding repayment of supplementary charge. (2) References in this Part to the licence interest are references to the interest in a UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 1. PART 13Onward sale Application of paragraphs 83 to 9081This Part applies if (a) the purchaser (referred to in this Part as the first purchaser) and the seller jointly make a TTH election (the first TTH election) in respect of an interest (the first TTH asset) in the TTH oil field; (b) the first purchaser subsequently sells to another company (the second purchaser) an interest in a UK oil licence which applies to the area which includes the TTH oil field; and (c) the first purchaser and the second purchaser jointly make a TTH election (the subsequent TTH election) in respect of an interest (the subsequent TTH asset) in the TTH oil field. 82 (1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies if (a) the first purchaser has an interest in the UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 1; in addition to the interest in that licence acquired from the seller; and (b) the UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 81 (b) is the same UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 1. (2) Interests in the licence acquired later by the first purchaser are treated; for the purposes of this Part; as being transferred to the second purchaser before interests in the licence acquired earlier by the first purchaser. Original TTH amount treated as eligible ring fence profits83 (1) This Schedule applies; for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election; as if the original TTH amount for all relevant accounting periods were an amount of the first purchasers eligible ring fence profits for that period. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) is subject to paragraphs 85 to 88. (3) In this Part of this Schedule; relevant accounting period means a pre-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser for which there is; immediately before the effective date of the subsequent TTH election; an unused transferred profits amount. (4) In this Part of this Schedule; references to the original TTH amount mean; in relation to a relevant accounting period (a) the unused transferred profits amount for that period; or (b) if the first TTH asset is not the same as the subsequent TTH asset; the relevant proportion of that amount for that period. (5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4) (b); the relevant proportion is the proportion that the subsequent TTH asset bears to the first TTH asset or; if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined on that basis; such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis. (6) In this paragraph; references to the unused transferred profits amount for an accounting period are references to (a) the transferred profits amount; in relation to the first TTH election; for that period; less (b) the total of the amounts applied for that period in accordance with paragraph 25; for the purposes of the application of that paragraph in relation to a loss period of the first purchaser. 84The original TTH amount for each relevant accounting period ceases to be treated; for the purposes of the first TTH election; as a transferred profits amount for that period in relation to the first purchaser. Original TTH amount transferred before eligible ring fence profits (subject to opt-out) 85 (1) Paragraphs 86 and 87 apply in relation to the subsequent TTH election; subject to sub-paragraph (2). (2) The first purchaser and the second purchaser may elect; at the time the TTH election is made; that neither paragraph 86 nor paragraph 87 applies in relation to the subsequent TTH election. 86 (1) The total TTH amount may not include an amount representing the first purchasers eligible ring fence profits for an accounting period unless it also includes an amount representing; in respect of each relevant accounting period; the original TTH amount for that period. (2) Paragraph 11 (consecutive accounting periods) does not apply in relation to an amount representing an original TTH amount for a relevant accounting period (but see sub-paragraph (3) ). (3) The total TTH amount may not include an amount representing the original TTH amount for a particular accounting period unless it also includes an amount representing the original TTH amount for the next following relevant accounting period. (4) If the original TTH amount exceeds the total TTH amount; the transferred profits amount for the earliest relevant accounting period must be an amount equal to (a) the total TTH amount; less (b) the transferred profits amount for later relevant accounting periods. (5) For the purposes of paragraph 12 (the transferred profits amount) (a) references to the earliest period are to be treated as references to the earliest accounting period for which there is a transferred profits amount by reason of the first purchasers eligible ring fence profits for that period (and not by reason of an original TTH amount for that period); and (b) the reference in sub-paragraph (2) to the TTH balance for the earliest period is to be treated as a reference to the TTH balance less the transferred profits amounts for each relevant accounting period. 87In the application of this Schedule for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election (a) in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 30 (TTH activation event); the reference to an allowance or allocation made to the purchaser includes a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83 (5) ) of an allowance or allocation made to the first purchaser; (b) in paragraph 30 (2) (b) and (3) (b); and in paragraph 31 (decommissioning expenditure amount); references to a post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser include references to a post-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser; (c) in paragraph 30 (3) as it applies in relation to post-acquisition accounting periods of the first purchaser; the reference to amounts attributable to the TTH asset is to be treated as a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83 (5) ) of those amounts; (d) in paragraph 30 (5) as it applies for the purposes of determining the total decommissioning expenditure amount in relation to a post-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser; the reference to the purchaser is to be treated as a reference to the first purchaser; (e) references in this Schedule to a pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser include references to a pre-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser; (f) references in paragraphs 83 to 86 and 89 to an amount of the first purchasers eligible ring fence profits do not includes references to an original TTH amount. Opt-out under paragraph 85 (2) : further provision about the application of this Schedule88 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) the first purchaser and the second purchaser make an election under paragraph 85 (2) (disapplication of paragraphs 86 and 87); and (b) in relation to the subsequent TTH election; the total TTH amount exceeds the total amount of the first purchasers eligible ring fence profits for (i) the accounting period which is; at the licence transfer date in relation to the subsequent TTH election; the first purchasers most recent qualifying accounting period in respect of which the amendment period has ended; and (ii) each earlier accounting period which is; in relation to the first TTH election; a post-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser. (2) In the application of this Schedule for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election (a) in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 30 (TTH activation event); the reference to an allowance or allocation made to the purchaser includes a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83 (5) ) of an allowance or allocation made to the first purchaser; (b) in paragraph 30 (2) (b) and (3) (b); and in paragraph 31 (decommissioning expenditure amount); references to a post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser include references to the accounting periods of the first purchaser mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b) (i) and (ii); (c) in paragraph 30 (3) as it applies in relation to the accounting periods of the first purchaser mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b) (i) and (ii); the reference to amounts attributable to the TTH asset is to be treated as a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83 (5) ) of those amounts; (d) in paragraph 30 (5) as it applies for the purposes of determining the total decommissioning expenditure amount in relation to an accounting period of the first purchaser mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) (b) (i) or (ii); the reference to the purchaser is to be treated as a reference to the first purchaser; (e) in paragraph 83 and in sub-paragraph (1) (b) of this paragraph; references to an amount of the first purchasers eligible ring fence profits do not include references to an original TTH amount. Supplementary charge: treatment of transferred adjusted ring fence profits89 (1) The provisions of this Schedule apply; for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election; as if (a) the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for each relevant accounting period; or (b) if the first TTH asset is not the same as the subsequent TTH asset; the relevant proportion of that amount for that period;were an amount of the first purchasers eligible adjusted ring fence profits for that period. (2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) (b); the relevant proportion means the proportion that the subsequent TTH asset bears to the first TTH asset or; if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined on that basis; such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis. Tracking90 (1) This paragraph applies if; after the effective date of the subsequent TTH election; the first purchaser continues to be liable for the decommissioning costs; or for a proportion of the decommissioning costs; for the subsequent TTH asset. (2) In the application of this Schedule for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election; references to the purchaser in paragraph 65 are to be treated; in respect of the period beginning with the effective date of the subsequent TTH election; as including references to the second purchaser. Sale by the second purchaser or subsequent sale91In the case of a sale by the second purchaser; or a subsequent sale; of an interest within paragraph 81 (c) in respect of which the parties make a TTH election (a) references in paragraph 86 to the original TTH amount are references to the original TTH amount in relation to each election; (b) amounts in relation to earlier elections are to be applied for the purposes of paragraph 86 (1) and (3) before amounts in relation to later elections; (c) the provisions of paragraph 87 apply in relation to the second purchaser; and each subsequent purchaser; as they apply in relation to the first purchaser; and (d) in paragraph 90 (i) the reference to the first purchaser in sub-paragraph (1) is treated as including a reference to the second purchaser; or a subsequent purchaser; and (ii) sub-paragraph (2) applies in relation to each subsequent purchaser as it applies in relation to the second purchaser. PART 14Supplementary Multiple interests in the same oil field92 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) interests in more than one UK oil licence are sold by the seller to the purchaser at the same time; and (b) the seller and the purchaser would be entitled to jointly make a TTH election in respect of more than one interest in the same oil field that falls within both licensed areas. (2) The seller and purchaser may jointly make a TTH election in respect of all interests in the oil field. (3) If an election is made in accordance with this paragraph; the interests mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) are to be treated as a single interest for the purposes of this Schedule (and references in this Schedule to the TTH asset are to be construed accordingly). Multiple TTH elections93 (1) This paragraph applies if; in a loss period; more than one TTH election in respect of the TTH asset has effect in relation to the purchaser. (2) For the purposes of paragraph 44 (allocation of activated TTH to an accounting period) (a) references to the unused transferred profits amount for an accounting period are to be treated as references to the total of the unused transferred profits amounts for that period in respect of each of the TTH elections; and (b) the amount in respect of a later TTH election is to be allocated to an accounting period before the amount which is subject to an earlier TTH election. Appeals94 (1) A person may appeal against (a) a decision that a penalty under paragraph 68 is payable by that person; (b) a decision to withdraw a TTH election under paragraph 72; (c) a decision to amend a TTH election under paragraph 74 (amounts discovered to be incorrect).

Relief where company ceases to be individuals personal company3In Part 5 of TCGA 1992 (transfer of business assets); after Chapter 3 (entrepreneurs relief) insert CHAPTER 3AEntrepreneurs' relief where company ceases to be individual's personal company 169SBOverview of ChapterThis Chapter makes provision about an individual claiming entrepreneurs relief in certain cases where relief would otherwise become unavailable because of a company ceasing to be the individuals personal company. 169SCElection by individual where company ceases to be personal company (1) If the following conditions are met; an individual may elect for this section to have effect. (2) The first condition is that; as a result of a relevant share issue; the company ceases to be the individuals personal company. (3) The second condition is that (a) if; immediately before the relevant share issue; the individual had made a disposal at their relevant value of all assets consisting of shares in or securities of the company; the disposal would have been a material disposal of business assets; and (b) if a claim for entrepreneurs relief had been made in respect of that disposal; a chargeable gain would have been treated by section 169N (2) as accruing to the individual. (4) Where this section has effect; the individual is to be treated for the purposes of this Act (a) as having made a disposal immediately before the relevant share issue of all assets consisting of shares in or securities of the company; and (b) immediately after that event; as having reacquired those assets;at their relevant value. (5) In this sectionmaterial disposal of business assets and personal company have the same meanings as in Chapter 3 (see section 169S);relevant share issue means an issue of shares by the company where (a) the shares are issued by the company for consideration consisting wholly of cash; and (b) the shares are subscribed; and issued; for genuine commercial reasons and not as part of arrangements the main purpose; or one of the main purposes; of which is to secure a tax advantage to any person; andrelevant value means (a) in relation to an asset consisting of shares; an amount equal to the consideration that would be apportioned to the asset if; immediately before the relevant share issue; the whole of the issued share capital of the company were sold for a consideration equal to its market value at that time; or (b) in relation to any other asset; its market value at the time of the relevant share issue. (6) For the purposes of the definition of relevant share issue in subsection (5) arrangements includes any agreement; understanding; scheme; transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable); andtax advantage means (a) relief or increased relief from tax; (b) repayment or increased repayment of tax; (c) the avoidance or reduction of a charge to tax or an assessment to tax; or (d) the avoidance of a possible assessment to tax;and for the purposes of this definition tax means capital gains tax; corporation tax or income tax. (7) In this Chapter (a) references to the notional disposal are references to the disposal mentioned in subsection (4) (a); (b) references to the notional gain are references to the chargeable gain mentioned in subsection (3) (b); and (c) references to shares in or securities of a company include references to interests in such shares or securities. 169SDSupplementary election to defer gains until subsequent disposal (1) An individual who makes an election under section 169SC may also elect that; for the purposes of this Act (a) no chargeable gain or allowable loss is to be treated as accruing to the individual on the notional disposal; but (b) a chargeable gain calculated in accordance with this section is to be treated as accruing to the individual on any subsequent disposal by the individual of one or more assets consisting of shares in or securities of the company (in addition to any gain or loss that actually accrues on that disposal). (2) The chargeable gain treated as accruing to the individual on a subsequent disposal is the amount resulting from the following stepsStep 1Attribute the notional gain to each of the classes of shares in or securities of the company which are the subject of the notional disposal. The attribution must be made; in relation to each class; by reference to the proportion that (a) the relevant gains (see section 169N (5) ) accruing on the notional disposal in respect of shares or securities within each class bears to (b) the total amount of relevant gains accruing on the notional disposal. Step 2Apportion the amount attributed to each class under Step 1 to the shares or securities of that class which are the subject of the subsequent disposal. The apportionment must be by reference to the proportion that (a) the nominal value of the shares or securities of that class which are the subject of the subsequent disposal bears to (b) the nominal value of shares or securities of that class which are the subject of the notional disposal. Step 3The amount resulting from these steps is (a) the total of the amounts apportioned to shares or securities under Step 2; but (b) excluding; in relation to each class of shares or securities; so much of those amounts as would; together with any chargeable gains treated by this section as accruing on previous disposals of shares or securities of that class; exceed the amount attributed to that class under Step 1.

(4) If the chargeable gain is a part only of the notional gain; each chargeable gain that subsequently accrues is to be treated for the purposes of section 169N as the amount resulting from a calculation under subsection (1) of that section carried out when that chargeable gain arises and because of the claim mentioned in subsection (2). (5) In relation to the claim for entrepreneurs relief in respect of the chargeable gain; the company is to be treated for the purposes of condition A in section 169I (6) as if it were; throughout the period of 2 years ending with the date of the subsequent disposal; the individuals personal company.

(2) The first condition is that one or more persons are under an obligation to accept the instrument as consideration for the provision of goods or services. (3) The second condition is that either or both of (a) the goods and services for the provision of which the instrument may be accepted as consideration; and (b) the persons who are under the obligation to accept the instrument as consideration for the provision of goods or services;are limited and are stated on or recorded in the instrument or the terms and conditions governing the use of the instrument.

(2) Relevant goods or services; in relation to a voucher; are any goods or services for the provision of which the voucher may be accepted as consideration. (3) References in this Schedule to the transfer of a voucher do not include the voucher being offered and accepted as consideration for the provision of relevant goods or services. (4) References in this Schedule to a voucher being offered or accepted as consideration for the provision of relevant goods or services include references to the voucher being offered or accepted as part consideration for the provision of relevant goods or services. VAT treatment of vouchers: general rule3 (1) The issue; and any subsequent transfer; of a voucher is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as a supply of relevant goods or services. (2) References in this Schedule to the paragraph 3 supply; in relation to the issue or transfer of a voucher; are to the supply of relevant goods or services treated by this paragraph as having been made on the issue or transfer of the voucher. Single purpose vouchers: special rules4 (1) A voucher is a single purpose voucher if; at the time it is issued; the following are known (a) the place of supply of the relevant goods or services; and (b) that any supply of relevant goods or services falls into a single supply category (and what that supply category is). (2) The supply categories are (a) supplies chargeable at the rate in force under section 2 (1) (standard rate); (b) supplies chargeable at the rate in force under section 29A (reduced rate); (c) zero-rated supplies; and (d) exempt supplies and other supplies that are not taxable supplies. (3) For the purposes of this paragraph; assume that the supply of relevant goods or services is the provision of relevant goods or services for which the voucher may be accepted as consideration (rather than the supply of relevant goods or services treated as made on the issue or transfer of the voucher). 5 (1) This paragraph applies where a single purpose voucher is accepted as consideration for the provision of relevant goods or services. (2) The provision of the relevant goods or services is not a supply of goods or services for the purposes of this Act. (3) But where the person who provides the relevant goods or services (the provider) is not the person who issued the voucher (the issuer); for the purposes of this Act the provider is to be treated as having made a supply of those goods or services to the issuer. Multi-purpose vouchers: special rules6A voucher is a multi-purpose voucher if it is not a single purpose voucher. 7 (1) Any consideration for the issue or subsequent transfer of a multi-purpose voucher is to be disregarded for the purposes of this Act. (2) The paragraph 3 supply made on the issue or subsequent transfer of a multi-purpose voucher is to be treated as not being a supply within section 26 (2). 8 (1) Where a multi-purpose voucher is accepted as consideration for the provision of relevant goods or services; for the purposes of this Act (a) the provision of the relevant goods or services is to be treated as a supply; and (b) the value of the supply treated as having been made by paragraph (a) is determined as follows. (2) If the consideration for the most recent transfer of the voucher for consideration is known to the supplier; the value of the supply is such amount as; with the addition of the VAT chargeable on the supply; is equal to that consideration. (3) If the consideration for the most recent transfer of the voucher for consideration is not known to the supplier; the value of the supply is such amount as; with the addition of the VAT chargeable on the supply; is equal to the face value of the voucher. (4) The face value of a voucher is the monetary value stated on or recorded in (a) the voucher; or (b) the terms and conditions governing the use of the voucher. Intermediaries9 (1) This paragraph applies where (a) a voucher is issued or transferred by an agent who acts in their own name; and (b) the paragraph 3 supply is a supply of services to which section 47 (3) would apply (apart from this paragraph). (2) Section 47 (3) does not apply. (3) The paragraph 3 supply is treated as both a supply to the agent and a supply by the agent. 10Nothing in this Schedule affects the application of this Act to any services provided; by a person who issues or transfers a voucher; in addition to the issue or transfer of the voucher. Composite transactions11 (1) This paragraph applies where; as part of a composite transaction (a) goods or services are supplied to a person; and (b) a voucher is issued or transferred to that person. (2) If the total consideration for the transaction is not different; or not significantly different; from what it would be if the voucher were not issued or transferred; the paragraph 3 supply is to be treated as being made for no consideration. 6In regulation 38ZA (2) of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (S.

PART 2Corporation tax; income tax and capital gains tax Distributions in respect of hybrid capital instruments2At the end of Chapter 12 of Part 5 of CTA 2009 insert Hybrid capital instruments 420AAmounts payable in respect of hybrid capital instruments (1) This section applies if a loan relationship is a hybrid capital instrument for an accounting period of the debtor. (2) The Corporation Tax Acts have effect in relation to any person in respect of times in the accounting period as if any qualifying amount payable in respect of the hybrid capital instrument were not a distribution. (3) An amount is a qualifying amount so far as it would not be regarded as a distribution if it is assumed that any provision made by the loan relationship under which the debtor is entitled to defer or cancel a payment of interest under the loan relationship had not been made. (4) This section also needs to be read together with section 1015 (1A) of CTA 2010 (which prevents hybrid capital instruments from being special securities as a result of being equity notes). 3 (1) After section 475B of CTA 2009 insert Meaning of hybrid capital instrument 475CMeaning of hybrid capital instrument (1) For the purposes of this Part; a loan relationship is a hybrid capital instrument for an accounting period of the debtor if (a) the loan relationship makes provision under which the debtor is entitled to defer or cancel a payment of interest under the loan relationship; (b) the loan relationship has no other significant equity features; and (c) the debtor has made an election in respect of the loan relationship which has effect for the period. (2) For the purposes of this section a loan relationship has no other significant equity features if under the loan relationship (a) there are neither voting rights in the debtor (ignoring insignificant voting rights in the debtor) nor a right to exercise a dominant influence over the debtor; (b) any provision for altering the amount of the debt is limited to write-down or conversion events in qualifying cases; and (c) any provision for the creditor to receive anything other than interest or repayment of the debt is limited to conversion events in qualifying cases. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) (a) (a) the loan relationship makes provision for insignificant voting rights in the debtor if (and only if) the voting rights of any creditor under the loan relationship are limited to one vote exercisable in relation to matters generally affecting the debtor without conferring any special advantage or other right on the creditor; and (b) a right to exercise a dominant influence over the debtor means a right to give directions with respect to the debtors operating and financial policies with which it is obliged to comply (whether or not they are for the debtors benefit).

(2) For the purposes of this paragraph tax-adjusted carrying value is to be construed in accordance with (a) section 465B of CTA 2009 (tax-adjusted carrying value in relation to the asset or liability representing a loan relationship); and (b) section 702 of CTA 2009 (tax-adjusted carrying value in relation to a contract). (3) Where in the 2024 period; in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice; the rights and liabilities under the transitional qualifying instrument have been treated as divided between (a) a loan relationship; and (b) one or more derivative financial instruments or equity instruments;the reference in this paragraph to the tax-adjusted carrying value of the transitional qualifying instrument means the sum of the tax-adjusted carrying values for each of those component instruments. (4) In sub-paragraph (3) equity instrument has the meaning it has for accounting purposes. 14 (1) This paragraph applies to a transitional qualifying instrument which qualified as a regulatory capital security as a result of falling within regulation 2 (1) (c) or (d) of the Taxation of Regulatory Capital Securities Regulations 2013. (2) The revocations made by paragraph 1 do not affect the application of regulation 3 (2) (c) (i) of those Regulations in a case where the writing down or conversion concerned took place before 1 July 2019. 15 (1) This paragraph applies if (a) regulation 3 (2) (c) (i) of the Taxation of Regulatory Capital Securities Regulations 2013 applied in relation to a transitional qualifying instrument as a result of the writing down of the principal amount of the security on a temporary basis; and (b) a credit was; accordingly; not brought into account under Part 5 of CTA 2009. (2) No debit is to be brought into account under that Part in respect of the writing up of the principal amount of the security in accordance with any regulatory requirements or the provisions governing the security. Commencement for purposes of income tax and CGT16 (1) The provision made by paragraphs 1 to 4 has effect for the purposes of income tax in relation to payments made on or after 1 January 2019. (2) But the revocations made by paragraph 1 (a) do not affect the application of regulation 6 or 9 of the Taxation of Regulatory Capital Securities Regulations 2013 in relation to payments made before the day on which this Act is passed; and (b) do not; in the case of a transitional qualifying instrument; apply to payments made before 1 January 2024 in any case where regulation 6 or 9 of those Regulations would have applied but for the provision made by paragraph 1. 17The revocations made by paragraph 1 have effect for the purposes of capital gains tax in relation to disposals made on or after 1 January 2019. 18In so far as it relates to the definition of corporate bond in section 117 (1) of TCGA 1992; the amendment made by paragraph 6 has effect in relation to disposals made on or after 1 January 2019.

(5) Where a determination under this paragraph is made in respect of the further fingerprints (a) the further fingerprints may be retained for as long as the original fingerprints are retained under any power conferred by paragraph 44 or 46; and (b) a requirement under any enactment to destroy the further fingerprints does not apply for as long as their retention is authorised by paragraph (a). (6) Sub-paragraph (5) (a) does not prevent the further fingerprints being retained after the original fingerprints fall to be destroyed if the continued retention of the further fingerprints is authorised under any enactment.
